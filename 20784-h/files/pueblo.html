IN TUSAYAN AND CIBOLA.</h3>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h5>


<p>The remains of pueblo architecture are found scattered over thousands
of square miles of the arid region of the southwestern plateaus. This
vast area includes the drainage of the Rio Pecos on the east and that of
the Colorado on the west, and extends from central Utah on the north
beyond the limits of the United States southward, in which direction its
boundaries are still undefined.</p>

<p>The descendants of those who at various times built these stone
villages are few in number and inhabit about thirty pueblos distributed
irregularly over parts of the region formerly occupied. Of these the
greater number are scattered along the upper course of the Rio Grande
and its tributaries in New Mexico; a&nbsp;few of them, comprised within the
ancient provinces of Cibola and Tusayan, are located within the drainage
of the Little Colorado. From the time of the earliest Spanish
expeditions into the country to the present day, a&nbsp;period covering more
than three centuries, the former province has been often visited by
whites, but the remoteness of Tusayan and the arid and forbidding
character of its surroundings have caused its more complete isolation.
The architecture of this district exhibits a close adherence to
aboriginal practices, still bears the marked impress of its development
under the exacting conditions of an arid environment, and is but slowly
yielding to the influence of foreign ideas.</p>

<p>The present study of the architecture of Tusayan and Cibola embraces
all of the inhabited pueblos of those provinces, and includes a number
of the ruins traditionally connected with them. It will be observed by
reference to the map that the area embraced in these provinces comprises
but a small portion of the vast region over which pueblo culture once
extended.</p>

<p>This study is designed to be followed by a similar study of two
typical groups of ruins, viz, that of Canyon de Chelly, in northeastern
Arizona, and that of the Chaco Canyon, of New Mexico; but it has been
necessary for the writer to make occasional reference to these ruins in
the present

paper, both in the discussion of general arrangement and characteristic
ground plans, embodied in Chapters <span class = "smallroman">II</span>
and <span class = "smallroman">III</span> and in the comparison by
constructional details treated in Chapter <span class =
"smallroman">IV</span>, in order to define clearly the relations of the
various features of pueblo architecture. They belong to the same pueblo
system illustrated by the villages of Tusayan and Cibola, and with the
Canyon de Chelly group there is even some trace of traditional
connection, as is set forth by Mr. Stephen in Chapter <span class =
"smallroman">I</span>. The more detailed studies of these ruins, to be
published later, together with the material embodied in the present
paper, will, it is thought, furnish a record of the principal
characteristics of an important type of primitive architecture, which,
under the influence of the arid environment of the southwestern
plateaus, has developed from the rude lodge into the many-storied house
of rectangular rooms. Indications of some of the steps of this
development are traceable even in the architecture of the present
day.</p>

<p>The pueblo of Zuñi was surveyed by the writer in the autumn of 1881
with a view to procuring the necessary data for the construction of a
large-scale model of this pueblo. For this reason the work afforded a
record of external features only.</p>

<p>The modern pueblos of Tusayan were similarly surveyed in the
following season (1882-’83), the plans being supplemented by
photographs, from which many of the illustrations accompanying this
paper have been drawn. The ruin of Awatubi was also included in the work
of this season.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1885 many of the ruined pueblos of Tusayan were
surveyed and examined. It was during this season’s work that the details
of the kiva construction, embodied in the last chapter of this paper,
were studied, together with interior details of the dwellings. It was in
the latter part of this season that the farming pueblos of Cibola were
surveyed and photographed.</p>

<p>The Tusayan farming pueblo of Moen-kopi and a number of the ruins in
the province were surveyed and studied in the early part of the season
of 1887-’88, the latter portion of which season was principally devoted
to an examination of the Chaco ruins in New Mexico.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of the field work above outlined the author has
been greatly indebted to the efficient assistance and hearty cooperation
of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, by whom nearly all the pueblos illustrated,
with the exception of Zuñi, have been surveyed and platted.</p>

<p>The plans obtained have involved much careful work with surveying
instruments, and have all been so platted as faithfully to record the
minute variations from geometric forms which are so characteristic of
the pueblo work, but which have usually been ignored in the hastily
prepared sketch plans that have at times appeared. In consequence of the
necessary omission of just such information in hastily drawn plans,
erroneous impressions have been given regarding the degree of skill to
which the pueblo peoples had attained in the planning and building of
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>

their villages. In the general distribution of the houses, and in the
alignment and arrangement of their walls, as indicated in the plans
shown in Chapters <span class = "smallroman">II</span> and <span class =
"smallroman">III</span>, an absence of high architectural attainment is
found, which is entirely in keeping with the lack of skill apparent in
many of the constructional devices shown in Chapter <span class =
"smallroman">IV</span>.</p>

<p>In preparing this paper for publication Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff has
rendered much assistance in the revision of manuscript, and in the
preparation of some of the final drawings of ground plans; on him has
also fallen the compilation and arrangement of Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen’s
traditionary material from Tusayan, embraced in the first chapter of the
paper.</p>

<p>This latter material is of special interest in a study of the pueblos
as indicating some of the conditions under which this architectural type
was developed, and it appropriately introduces the more purely
architectural study by the author.</p>

<p>Such traditions must be used as history with the utmost caution, and
only for events that are very recent. Time relations are often
hopelessly confused and the narratives are greatly incumbered with
mythologic details. But while so barren in definite information, these
traditions are of the greatest value, often through their merely
incidental allusions, in presenting to our minds a picture of the
conditions under which the repeated migrations of the pueblo builders
took place.</p>

<p>The development of architecture among the Pueblo Indians was
comparatively rapid and is largely attributable to frequent changes,
migrations, and movements of the people as described in Mr. Stephen’s
account. These changes were due to a variety of causes, such as disease,
death, the frequent warfare carried on between different tribes and
branches of the builders, and the hostility of outside tribes; but a
most potent factor was certainly the inhospitable character of their
environment. The disappearance of some venerated spring during an
unusually dry season would be taken as a sign of the disfavor of the
gods, and, in spite of the massive character of the buildings, would
lead to the migration of the people to a more favorable spot. The
traditions of the Zuñis, as well as those of the Tusayan, frequently
refer to such migrations. At times tribes split up and separate, and
again phratries or distant groups meet and band together. It is
remarkable that the substantial character of the architecture should
persist through such long series of compulsory removals, but while the
builders were held together by the necessity for defense against their
wilder neighbors or against each other, this strong defensive motive
would perpetuate the laborious type of construction. Such conditions
would contribute to the rapid development of the building art.</p>

<h5 class = "section"><a name = "chapI_1" id =

<p>In this chapter<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> is presented a summary of the traditions of the Tusayan,
a number of which were collected from old men, from Walpi on the east to
Moen-kopi on the west. A&nbsp;tradition varies much with the tribe and the
individual; an authoritative statement of the current tradition on any
point could be made only with a complete knowledge of all traditions
extant. Such knowledge is not possessed by any one man, and the material
included in this chapter is presented simply as a summary of the
traditions secured.</p>

<p>The material was collected by Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen, of Keam’s
Canyon, Arizona, who has enjoyed unusual facilities for the work, having
lived for a number of years past in Tusayan and possessed the confidence
of the principal priests&mdash;a very necessary condition in work of
this character. Though far from complete, this summary is a more
comprehensive presentation of the traditionary history of these people
than has heretofore been published.</p>


<h5 class = "section"><a name = "chapI_2" id = "chapI_2">
SUMMARY OF TRADITIONS.</a></h5>

<p>The creation myths of the Tusayan differ widely, but none of them
designate the region now occupied as the place of their genesis. These
people are socially divided into family groups called wi´ngwu, the
descendants of sisters, and groups of wi´ngwu tracing descent from the
same female ancestor, and having a common totem called my´umu. Each of
these totemic groups preserves a creation myth, carrying in its details
special reference to themselves; but all of them claim a common origin
in the interior of the earth, although the place of emergence to the
surface is set in widely separated localities. They all agree in
maintaining this to be the fourth plane on which mankind has existed. In
the beginning all men lived together in the lowest depths, in a region
of darkness and moisture; their bodies were misshaped and horrible, and
they suffered great misery, moaning and bewailing continually. Through
the intervention of Myúingwa (a&nbsp;vague conception known as the god
of the interior) and of Baholikonga (a&nbsp;crested serpent of enormous
size, the genius of water), the “old men” obtained a seed from which
sprang a magic growth of cane. It penetrated through a crevice
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page017" id = "page017"> </a>
<!--png 060-->
in the roof overhead and mankind climbed to a higher plane. A&nbsp;dim light
appeared in this stage and vegetation was produced. Another magic growth
of cane afforded the means of rising to a still higher plane on which
the light was brighter; vegetation was reproduced and the animal kingdom
was created. The final ascent to this present, or fourth plane, was
effected by similar magic growths and was led by mythic twins, according
to some of the myths, by climbing a great pine tree, in others by
climbing the cane, <i>Phragmites communis</i>, the alternate leaves of
which afforded steps as of a ladder, and in still others it is said to
have been a rush, through the interior of which the people passed up to
the surface. The twins sang as they pulled the people out, and when
their song was ended no more were allowed to come; and hence, many more
were left below than were permitted to come above; but the outlet
through which mankind came has never been closed, and Myu´ingwa sends
through it the germs of all living things. It is still symbolized by the
peculiar construction of the hatchway of the kiva and in the designs on
the sand altars in these underground chambers, by the unconnected circle
painted on pottery and by devices on basketry and other textile
fabrics.</p>

Plate III. General view of Awatubi.</p>

<p>All the people that were permitted to come to the surface were
collected and the different families of men were arranged together. This
was done under the direction of twins, who are called Pekónghoya, the
younger one being distinguished by the term Balíngahoya, the Echo. They
were assisted by their grandmother, Kóhkyang wúhti, the Spider woman,
and these appear in varying guises in many of the myths and legends.
They instructed the people in divers modes of life to dwell on mountain
or on plain, to build lodges, or huts, or windbreaks. They distributed
appropriate gifts among them and assigned each a pathway, and so the
various families of mankind were dispersed over the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>The Hopituh,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> after being taught to build stone houses, were also
divided, and the different divisions took separate paths. The legends
indicate a long period of extensive migrations in separate communities;
the groups came to Tusayan at different times and from different
directions, but the people of all the villages concur in designating the
Snake people as the first occupants of the region. The eldest member of
that nyumu tells a curious legend of their migration from which the
following is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
At the general dispersal my people lived in snake skins, each family
occupying a separate snake skin bag, and all were hung on the end of a
rainbow, which swung around until the end touched Navajo Mountain, where
the bags dropped from it; and wherever a bag dropped, there was their
house. After they arranged their bags they came out from them as men and
women, and they then, built a stone house which had five sides. [The
story here relates the adventures of a mythic Snake Youth, who brought
back a strange woman who gave birth to rattlesnakes; these bit the
people and compelled them to migrate.] A brilliant star arose in the
southeast,
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page018" id = "page018"> </a>
<!--png 061-->
which would shine for a while and then disappear. The old men said,
“Beneath that star there must be people,” so they determined to travel
toward it. They cut a staff and set it in the ground and watched till
the star reached its top, then they started and traveled as long as the
star shone; when it disappeared they halted. But the star did not shine
every night, for sometimes many years elapsed before it appeared again.
When this occurred, our people built houses during their halt; they
built both round and square houses, and all the ruins between here and
Navajo Mountain mark the places where our people lived. They waited till
the star came to the top of the staff again, then they moved on, but
many people were left in those houses and they followed afterward at
various times. When our people reached Wipho (a&nbsp;spring a few miles
north from Walpi) the star disappeared and has never been seen since.
They built a house there and after a time Másauwu (the god of the face
of the earth) came and compelled them to move farther down the valley,
to a point about half way between the East and Middle Mesa, and there
they stayed many plantings. One time the old men were assembled and
Másauwu came among them, looking like a horrible skeleton, and his bones
rattling dreadfully. He menaced them with awful gestures, and lifted off
his fleshless head and thrust it into their faces; but he could not
frighten them. So he said, “I&nbsp;have lost my wager; all that I have is
yours; ask for anything you want and I will give it to you.” At that
time our people’s house was beside the water course, and Másauwu said,
“Why are you sitting here in the mud? Go up yonder where it is dry.” So
they went across to the low, sandy terrace on the west side of the mesa,
near the point, and built a house and lived there. Again the old men
were assembled and two demons came among them and the old men took the
great Baho and the nwelas and chased them away. When they were
returning, and were not far north from their village, they met the
Lenbaki (Cane-Flute, a&nbsp;religious society still maintained) of the Horn
family. The old men would not allow them to come in until Másauwu
appeared and declared them to be good Hopituh. So they built houses
adjoining ours and that made a fine, large village. Then other Hopituh
came in from time to time, and our people would say, “Build here, or
build there,” and portioned the land among the new comers.</blockquote>

<p>The site of the first Snake house in the valley, mentioned in the
foregoing legend, is now barely to be discerned, and the people refuse
to point out the exact spot. It is held as a place of votive offerings
during the ceremony of the Snake dance, and, as its name, Bátni,
implies, certain rain-fetiches are deposited there in small jars buried
in the ground. The site of the village next occupied can be quite easily
distinguished, and is now called Kwetcap tutwi, ash heap terrace, and
this was the village to which the name Walpi was first applied&mdash;a
term meaning the place at the notched mesa, in allusion to a broad gap
in the stratum of sandstone on the summit of the mesa, and by which it
can be distinguished from a great distance. The ground plan of this
early Walpi can still be partly traced, indicating the former existence
of an extensive village of clustering, little-roomed houses, with thick
walls constructed of small stones.</p>

<p>The advent of the Lenbaki is still commemorated by a biennial
ceremony, and is celebrated on the year alternating with their other
biennial ceremony, the Snake dance.</p>

<p>The Horn people, to which the Lenbaki belonged, have a legend of
coming from a mountain range in the east.</p>

<blockquote>
Its peaks were always snow covered, and the trees were always green.
From the hillside the plains were seen, over which roamed the deer, the
antelope, and the
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page019" id = "page019"> </a>
<!--png 064-->
bison, feeding on never-failing grasses. Twining through these plains
were streams of bright water, beautiful to look upon. A&nbsp;place where none
but those who were of our people ever gained access.</blockquote>

<p>This description suggests some region of the head-waters of the Rio
Grande. Like the Snake people, they tell of a protracted migration, not
of continuous travel, for they remained for many seasons in one place,
where they would plant and build permanent houses. One of these halting
places is described as a canyon with high, steep walls, in which was a
flowing stream; this, it is said, was the Tségi (the Navajo name for
Canyon de Chelly). Here they built a large house in a cavernous recess,
high up in the canyon wall. They tell of devoting two years<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> to ladder making
and cutting and pecking shallow holes up the steep rocky side by which
to mount to the cavern, and three years more were employed in building
the house. While this work was in progress part of the men were planting
gardens, and the women and children were gathering stones. But no
adequate reason is given for thus toiling to fit this impracticable site
for occupation; the footprints of Másauwu, which they were following,
led them there.</p>

<p>The legend goes on to tell that after they had lived there for a long
time a stranger happened to stray in their vicinity, who proved to be a
Hopituh, and said that he lived in the south. After some stay he left
and was accompanied by a party of the “Horn,” who were to visit the land
occupied by their kindred Hopituh and return with an account of them;
but they never came back. After waiting a long time another band was
sent, who returned and said that the first emissaries had found wives
and had built houses on the brink of a beautiful canyon, not far from
the other Hopituh dwellings. After this many of the Horns grew
dissatisfied with their cavern home, dissensions arose, they left their
home, and finally they reached Tusayan. They lived at first in one of
the canyons east of the villages, in the vicinity of Keam’s Canyon, and
some of the numerous ruins on its brink mark the sites of their early
houses. There seems to be no legend distinctly attaching any particular
ruin to the Horn people, although there is little doubt that the Snake
and the Horn were the two first peoples who came to the neighborhood of
the present villages. The Bear people were the next, but they arrived as
separate branches, and from opposite directions, although of the same
Hopituh stock. It has been impossible to obtain directly the legend of
the Bears from the west. The story of the Bears from the east tells of
encountering the Fire people, then living about 25 miles east from
Walpi; but these are now extinct, and nearly all that is known of them
is told in the Bear legend, the gist of which is as follows:</p>

<p>The Bears originally lived among the mountains of the east, not far
distant from the Horns. Continual quarrels with neighboring villages
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page020" id = "page020"> </a>
<!--png 065-->
brought on actual fighting, and the Bears left that region and traveled
westward. As with all the other people, they halted, built houses, and
planted, remaining stationary for a long while; this occurred at
different places along their route.</p>

<p>A portion of these people had wings, and they flew in advance to
survey the land, and when the main body were traversing an arid region
they found water for them. Another portion had claws with which they dug
edible roots, and they could also use them for scratching hand and foot
holes in the face of a steep cliff. Others had hoofs, and these carried
the heaviest burdens; and some had balls of magic spider web, which they
could use on occasion for ropes, and they could also spread the web and
use it as a mantle, rendering the wearer invisible when he apprehended
danger.</p>

<p>They too came to the Tségi (Canyon de Chelly), where they found
houses but no people, and they also built houses there. While living
there a rupture occurred, a&nbsp;portion of them separating and going far to
the westward. These seceding bands are probably that branch of the Bears
who claim their origin in the west. Some time after this, but how long
after is not known, a&nbsp;plague visited the canyon, and the greater portion
of the people moved away, but leaving numbers who chose to remain. They
crossed the Chinli valley and halted for a short time at a place a short
distance northeast from Great Willow water (“Eighteen Mile Spring”).
They did not remain there long, however, but moved a few miles farther
west, to a place occupied by the Fire people who lived in a large oval
house. The ruin of this house still stands, the walls from 5 to 8 feet
high, and remarkable from the large-sized blocks of stone used in their
construction; it is still known to the Hopituh as Tebvwúki, the
Fire-house. Here some fighting occurred, and the Bears moved westward
again to the head of Antelope (Jeditoh) Canyon, about 4 miles from
Keam’s Canyon and about 15 miles east from Walpi. They built there a
rambling cluster of small-roomed houses, of which the ground plan has
now become almost obliterated. This ruin is called by the Hopituh “the
ruin at the place of wild gourds.” They seem to have occupied this
neighborhood for a considerable period, as mention is made of two or
three segregations, when groups of families moved a few miles away and
built similar house clusters on the brink of that canyon.</p>

<p>The Fire-people, who, some say, were of the Horn people, must have
abandoned their dwelling at the Oval House or must have been driven out
at the time of their conflict with the Bears, and seem to have traveled
directly to the neighborhood of Walpi. The Snakes allotted them a place
to build in the valley on the east side of the mesa, and about two miles
north from the gap. A&nbsp;ridge of rocky knolls and sand dunes lies at the
foot of the mesa here, and close to the main cliff is a spring. There
are two prominent knolls about 400 yards apart and the summits of these
are covered with traces of house walls; also portions of walls can be
discerned on all the intervening hummocks. The place is known as
Sikyátki,
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page021" id = "page021"> </a>
<!--png 068-->
the yellow-house, from the color of the sandstone of which the houses
were built. These and other fragmentary bits have walls not over a foot
thick, built of small stones dressed by rubbing, and all laid in mud;
the inside of the walls also show a smooth coating of mud plaster. The
dimensions of the rooms are very small, the largest measuring 9½ feet
long, by 4½ feet wide. It is improbable that any of these structures
were over two stories high, and many of them were built in excavated
places around the rocky summits of the knolls. In these instances no
rear wall was built; the partition walls, radiating at irregular angles,
abut against the rock itself. Still, the great numbers of these houses,
small as they were, must have been far more than the Fire-people could
have required, for the oval house which they abandoned measures not more
than a hundred feet by fifty. Probably other incoming gentes, of whom no
story has been preserved, had also the ill fate to build there, for the
Walpi people afterward slew all its inhabitants.</p>

<p>There is little or no detail in the legends of the Bear people as to
their life in Antelope Canyon; they can now distinguish only one ruin
with certainty as having been occupied by their ancestors, while to all
the other ruins fanciful names have been applied. Nor is there any
special cause mentioned for abandoning their dwellings there; probably,
however, a&nbsp;sufficient reason was the cessation of springs in their
vicinity. Traces of former large springs are seen at all of them, but no
water flows from them at the present time. Whatever their motive, the
Bears left Antelope <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Cañyon’">Canyon</ins>,
and moved over to the village of Walpi, on the
terrace below the point of the mesa. They were received kindly there,
and were apparently placed on an equal footing with the Walpi, for it
seems the Snake, Horn, and Bear have always been on terms of friendship.
They built houses at that village, and lived there for some considerable
time; then they moved a short distance and built again almost on the
very point of the mesa. This change was not caused by any disagreement
with their neighbors; they simply chose that point as a suitable place
on which to build all their houses together. The site of this Bear house
is called Kisákobi, the obliterated house, and the name is very
appropriate, as there is merely the faintest trace here and there to
show where a building stood, the stones having been used in the
construction of the modern Walpi. These two villages were quite close
together, and the subsequent construction of a few additional groups of
rooms almost connected them, so that they were always considered and
spoken of as one.</p>

<p>It was at this period, while Walpi was still on this lower site, that
the Spaniards came into the country. They met with little or no
opposition, and their entrance was marked by no great disturbances. No
special tradition preserves any of the circumstances of this event;
these first coming Spaniards being only spoken of as the “Kast´ilumuh
who wore iron garments, and came from the south,” and this brief mention
may be accounted for by the fleeting nature of these early visits.</p>

<p>The zeal of the Spanish priests carried them everywhere throughout
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page022" id = "page022"> </a>
<!--png 069-->
their newly acquired territory, and some time in the seventeenth century
a band of missionary monks found their way to Tusayan. They were
accompanied by a few troops to impress the people with a due regard for
Spanish authority, but to display the milder side of their mission, they
also brought herds of sheep and cattle for distribution. At first these
were herded at various springs within a wide radius around the villages,
and the names still attaching to these places memorize the introduction
of sheep and cattle to this region. The Navajo are first definitely
mentioned in tradition as occupants of this vicinity in connection with
these flocks and herds, in the distribution of which they gave much
undesirable assistance by driving off the larger portion to their own
haunts.</p>

<p>The missionaries selected Awatubi, Walpi, and Shumopavi as the sites
for their mission buildings, and at once, it is said, began to introduce
a system of enforced labor. The memory of the mission period is held in
great detestation, and the onerous toil the priests imposed is still
adverted to as the principal grievance. Heavy pine timbers, many of
which are now pointed out in the kiva roofs, of from 15 to 20 feet in
length and a foot or more in diameter, were cut at the San Francisco
Mountain, and gangs of men were compelled to carry and drag them to the
building sites, where they were used as house beams. This necessitated
prodigious toil, for the distance by trail is a hundred miles, most of
the way over a rough and difficult country. The Spaniards are said to
have employed a few ox teams in this labor, but the heaviest share was
performed by the impressed Hopituh, who were driven in gangs by the
Spanish soldiers, and any who refused to work were confined in a prison
house and starved into submission.</p>

<p>The “men with the long robes,” as the missionaries were called, are
said to have lived among these people for a long time, but no trace of
their individuality survives in tradition.</p>

<p>Possibly the Spanish missionaries may have striven to effect some
social improvement among these people, and by the adoption of some harsh
measures incurred the jealous anger of the chiefs. But the system of
labor they enforced was regarded, perhaps justly, as the introduction of
serfdom, such as then prevailed in the larger communities in the Rio
Grande valleys. Perhaps tradition belies them; but there are many
stories of their evil, sensual lives&mdash;assertions that they violated
women, and held many of the young girls at their mission houses, not as
pupils, but as concubines.</p>

<p>In any case, these hapless monks were engaged in a perilous mission
in seeking to supplant the primitive faith of the Tusayan, for among the
native priests they encountered prejudices even as violent as their own.
With too great zeal they prohibited the sacred dances, the votive
offerings to the nature-deities, and similar public observances, and
strove to suppress the secret rites and abolish the religious orders and
societies. But these were too closely incorporated with the system of
gentes and
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page023" id = "page023"> </a>
<!--png 072-->
other family kinships to admit of their extinction. Traditionally, it is
said that, following the discontinuance of the prescribed ceremonies,
the favor of the gods was withdrawn, the clouds brought no rain, and the
fields yielded no corn. Such a coincidence in this arid region is by no
means improbable, and according to the legends, a&nbsp;succession of dry
seasons resulting in famine has been of not infrequent occurrence. The
superstitious fears of the people were thus aroused, and they cherished
a mortal hatred of the monks.</p>

<p>In such mood were they in the summer of 1680, when the village
Indians rose in revolt, drove out the Spaniards, and compelled them to
retreat to Mexico. There are some dim traditions of that event still
existing among the Tusayan, and they tell of one of their own race
coming from the river region by the way of Zuñi to obtain their
cooperation in the proposed revolt. To this they consented.</p>

<p>Only a few Spaniards being present at that time, the Tusayan found
courage to vent their enmity in massacre, and every one of the hated
invaders perished on the appointed day. The traditions of the massacre
center on the doom of the monks, for they were regarded as the
embodiment of all that was evil in Spanish rule, and their pursuit, as
they tried to escape among the sand dunes, and the mode of their
slaughter, is told with grim precision; they were all overtaken and
hacked to pieces with stone tomahawks.</p>

<p>It is told that while the monks were still in authority some of the
Snake women urged a withdrawal from Walpi, and, to incite the men to
action, carried their mealing-stones and cooking vessels to the summit
of the mesa, where they desired the men to build new houses, less
accessible to the domineering priests. The men followed them, and two or
three small house groups were built near the southwest end of the
present village, one of them being still occupied by a Snake family, but
the others have been demolished or remodeled. A&nbsp;little farther north,
also on the west edge, the small house clusters there were next built by
the families of two women called Tji-vwó-wati and Si-kya-tcí-wati.
Shortly after the massacre the lower village was entirely abandoned, and
the building material carried above to the point which the Snakes had
chosen, and on which the modern Walpi was constructed. Several beams of
the old mission houses are now pointed out in the roofs of the
kivas.</p>

<p>There was a general apprehension that the Spaniards would send a
force to punish them, and the Shumopavi also reconstructed their village
in a stronger position, on a high mesa overlooking its former site. The
other villages were already in secure positions, and all the smaller
agricultural settlements were abandoned at this period, and excepting at
one or two places on the Moen-kopi, the Tusayan have ever since confined
themselves to the close vicinity of their main villages.</p>

<p>The house masses do not appear to bear any relation to division by
phratries. It is surprising that even the social division of the
phratries
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page024" id = "page024"> </a>
<!--png 073-->
is preserved. The Hopituh certainly marry within phratries, and
occasionally with the same gens. There is no doubt, however, that in the
earlier villages each gens, and where practicable, the whole of the
phratry, built their houses together. To a certain extent the house of
the priestess of a gens is still regarded as the home of the gens. She
has to be consulted concerning proposed marriages, and has much to say
in other social arrangements.</p>

<p>While the village of the Walpi was still upon the west side of the
mesa point, some of them moved around and built houses beside a spring
close to the east side of the mesa. Soon after this a dispute over
planting ground arose between them and the Sikyátki, whose village was
also on that side of the mesa and but a short distance above them. From
this time forward bad blood lay between the Sikyátki and the Walpi, who
took up the quarrel of their suburb. It also happened about that time,
so tradition says, more of the Coyote people came from the north, and
the Pikyás nyu-mu, the young cornstalk, who were the latest of the Water
people, came in from the south. The Sikyátki, having acquired their
friendship, induced them to build on two mounds, on the summit of the
mesa overlooking their village. They had been greatly harrassed by the
young slingers and archers of Walpi, who would come across to the edge
of the high cliff and assail them with impunity, but the occupation of
these two mounds by friends afforded effectual protection to their
village. These knolls are about 40 yards apart, and about 40 feet above
the level of the mesa which is something over 400 feet above Sikyátki.
Their roughly leveled summits measure 20 by 10 feet and are covered with
traces of house walls; and it is evident that groups of small-roomed
houses were clustered also around the sloping sides. About a hundred
yards south from their dwellings the people of the mounds built for
their own protection a strong wall entirely across the mesa, which at
that point is contracted to about 200 feet in width, with deep vertical
cliffs on either side. The base of the wall is still quite distinct, and
is about 3 feet thick.</p>

<p>But no reconciliation was ever effected between the Walpi and the
Sikyátki and their allies, and in spite of their defensive wall frequent
assaults were made upon the latter until they were forced to retreat.
The greater number of them retired to Oraibi and the remainder to
Sikyátki, and the feud was still maintained between them and the
Walpi.</p>

<p>Some of the incidents as well as the disastrous termination of this
feud are still narrated. A&nbsp;party of the Sikyátki went prowling through
Walpi one day while the men were afield, and among other outrages, one
of them shot an arrow through a window and killed a chief’s daughter
while she was grinding corn. The chief’s son resolved to avenge the
death of his sister, and some time after this went to Sikyátki,
professedly to take part in a religious dance, in which he joined until
just before the close of the ceremony. Having previously observed where
the handsomest girl was seated among the spectators on the house
terraces,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page025" id = "page025"> </a>
<!--png 076-->
he ran up the ladder as if to offer her a prayer emblem, but instead he
drew out a sharp flint knife from his girdle and cut her throat. He
threw the body down where all could see it, and ran along the adjoining
terraces till he cleared the village. A&nbsp;little way up the mesa was a
large flat rock, upon which he sprang and took off his dancer’s mask so
that all might recognize him; then turning again to the mesa he sped
swiftly up the trail and escaped.</p>

<p>And so foray and slaughter continued to alternate between them until
the planting season of some indefinite year came around. All the
Sikyátki men were to begin the season by planting the fields of their
chief on a certain day, which was announced from the housetop by the
Second Chief as he made his customary evening proclamations, and the
Walpi, becoming aware of this, planned a fatal onslaught. Every man and
woman able to draw a bow or wield a weapon were got in readiness and at
night they crossed the mesa and concealed themselves along its edge,
overlooking the doomed village. When the day came they waited until the
men had gone to the field and then rushed down upon the houses. The
chief, who was too old to go afield, was the first one killed, and then
followed the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children, and the
destruction of the houses. The wild tumult in the village alarmed the
Sikyátki and they came rushing back, but too late to defend their homes.
Their struggles were hopeless, for they had only their planting sticks
to use as weapons, which availed but little against the Walpi with their
bows and arrows, spears, slings, and war clubs. Nearly all of the
Sikyátki men were killed, but some of them escaped to Oraibi and some to
Awatubi. A&nbsp;number of the girls and younger women were spared, and
distributed among the different villages, where they became wives of
their despoilers.</p>

<p>It is said to have been shortly after the destruction of Sikyátki
that the first serious inroad of a hostile tribe occurred within this
region, and all the stories aver that these early hostiles were from the
north, the Ute being the first who are mentioned, and after them the
Apache, who made an occasional foray.</p>

<p>While these families of Hopituh stock had been building their
straggling dwellings along the canyon brinks, and grouping in villages
around the base of the East Mesa, other migratory bands of Hopituh had
begun to arrive on the Middle Mesa. As already said, it is admitted that
the Snake were the first occupants of this region, but beyond that fact
the traditions are contradictory and confused. It is probable, however,
that not long after the arrival of the Horn, the Squash people came from
the south and built a village on the Middle Mesa, the ruin of which is
called Chukubi. It is on the edge of the cliff on the east side of the
neck of that mesa, and a short distance south of the direct trail
leading from Walpi to Oraibi. The Squash people say that they came from
Palát Kwabi, the Red Land in the far South, and this vague term
expresses nearly all their knowledge of that traditional land. They say
they lived

<!--png 077-->
for a long time in the valley of the Colorado Chiquito, on the south
side of that stream and not far from the point where the railway crosses
it. They still distinguish the ruin of their early village there, which
was built as usual on the brink of a canyon, and call it Etípsíkya,
after a shrub that grows there profusely. They crossed the river
opposite that place, but built no permanent houses until they reached
the vicinity of Chukubi, near which two smaller clusters of ruins, on
knolls, mark the sites of dwellings which they claim to have been
theirs. Three groups (nyumu) traveling together were the next to follow
them; these were the Bear, the Bear-skin-rope, and the Blue Jay. They
are said to have been very numerous, and to have come from the vicinity
of San Francisco Mountain. They did not move up to Chukubi, but built a
large village on the summit, at the south end of the mesa, close to the
site of the present Mashongnavi. Soon afterward came the Burrowing Owl,
and the Coyote, from the vicinity of Navajo Mountains in the north, but
they were not very numerous. They also built upon the Mashongnavi
summit.</p>

<p>After this the Squash people found that the water from their springs
was decreasing, and began moving toward the end of the mesa, where the
other people were. But as there was then no suitable place left on the
summit, they built a village on the sandy terrace close below it, on the
west side; and as the springs at Chukubi ultimately ceased entirely, the
rest of the Squash people came to the terrace and were again united in
one village. Straggling bands of several other groups, both wingwu and
nyumu, are mentioned as coming from various directions. Some built on
the terrace and some found house room in Mashongnavi. This name is
derived as follows: On the south side of the terrace on which the Squash
village was built is a high column of sandstone which is vertically
split in two, and formerly there was a third pillar in line, which has
long since fallen. These three columns were called Tútuwalha, the
guardians, and both the Squash village and the one on the summit were so
named. On the north side of the terrace, close to the present village,
is another irregular massy pillar of sandstone called Mashóniniptu,
meaning “the other which remains erect,” having reference to the one on
the south side, which had fallen. When the Squash withdrew to the summit
the village was then called Mashóniniptuovi, “at the place of the other
which remains erect;” now that term is never used, but always its
syncopated form, Mashongnavi.</p>

<p>The Squash village, on the south end of the Middle Mesa, was attacked
by a fierce band that came from the north, some say the Ute, others say
the Apache; but whoever the invaders were, they completely overpowered
the people, and carried off great stores of food and other plunder. The
village was then evacuated, the houses dismantled, and the material
removed to the high summit, where they reconstructed their dwellings
around the village which thenceforth bore its present name of
Mashongnavi. Some of the Squash people moved over to Oraibi, and
portions of the Katchina and Paroquet people came from
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page027" id = "page027"> </a>
<!--png 080-->
there to Mashongnavi about the same time, and a few of these two groups
occupied some vacant houses also in Shupaulovi; for this village even at
that early date had greatly diminished in population, having sustained a
disastrous loss of men in the canyon affrays east of Walpi.</p>

<p>Shumopavi seems to have been built by portions of the same groups who
went to the adjacent Mashongnavi, but the traditions of the two villages
are conflicting. The old traditionists at Shumopavi hold that the first
to come there were the Paroquet, the Bear, the Bear-skin-rope, and the
Blue Jay. They came from the west&mdash;probably from San Francisco
Mountain. They claim that ruins on a mesa bluff about 10 miles south
from the present village are the remains of a village built by these
groups before reaching Shumopavi, and the Paroquets arrived first, it is
said, because they were perched on the heads of the Bears, and, when
nearing the water, they flew in ahead of the others. These groups built
a village on a broken terrace, on the east side of the cliff, and just
below the present village. There is a spring close by called after the
Shunóhu, a&nbsp;tall red grass, which grew abundantly there, and from which
the town took its name. This spring was formerly very large, but two
years ago a landslide completely buried it; lately, however, a&nbsp;small
outflow is again apparent.</p>

<p>The ruins of the early village cover a hillocky area of about 800 by
250 feet, but it is impossible to trace much of the ground plan with
accuracy. The corner of an old house still stands, some 6 or 8 feet
high, extending about 15 feet on one face and about 10 feet on the
other. The wall is over 3 feet in thickness, but of very clumsy masonry,
no care having been exercised in dressing the stones, which are of
varying sizes and laid in mud plaster. Interest attaches to this
fragment, as it is one of the few tangible evidences left of the Spanish
priests who engaged in the fatal mission to the Hopituh in the sixteenth
century. This bit of wall, which now forms part of a sheep-fold, is
pointed out as the remains of one of the mission buildings.</p>

<p>Other groups followed&mdash;the Mole, the Spider, and the “Wíksrun.”
These latter took their name from a curious ornament worn by the men. A
piece of the leg-bone of a bear, from which the marrow had been
extracted and a stopper fixed in one end, was attached to the fillet
binding the hair, and hung down in front of the forehead. This gens and
the Mole are now extinct.</p>

<p>Shumopavi received no further accession of population, but lost to
some extent by a portion of the Bear people moving across to Walpi. No
important event seems to have occurred among them for a long period
after the destruction of Sikyátki, in which they bore some part, and
only cursory mention is made of the ingress of “enemies from the north;”
but their village, apparently, was not assailed.</p>

<p>The Oraibi traditions tend to confirm those of Shumopavi, and tell
that the first houses there were built by Bears, who came from the
latter place. The following is from a curious legend of the early
settlement:</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page028" id = "page028"> </a>
<!--png 081-->
The Bear people had two chiefs, who were brothers; the elder was called
Vwen-ti-só-mo, and the younger Ma-tcí-to. They had a desperate quarrel
at Shumopavi, and their people divided into two factions, according as
they inclined to one or other of the contestants. After a long period of
contention Ma-tcí-to and his followers withdrew to the mesa where Oraibi
now stands, about 8 miles northwest from Shumopavi, and built houses a
little to the southwest of the limits of the present town. These houses
were afterwards destroyed by “enemies from the north,” and the older
portion of the existing town, the southwest ends of the house rows, were
built with stones from the demolished houses. Fragments of these early
walls are still occasionally unearthed.</p>

<p>After Ma-tcí-to and his people were established there, whenever any
of the Shumopavi people became dissatisfied with that place they built
at Oraibi, Ma-tcí-to placed a little stone monument about halfway
between these two villages to mark the boundary of the land.
Vwenti-so´-mo objected to this, but it was ultimately accepted with the
proviso that the village growing the fastest should have the privilege
of moving it toward the other village. The monument still stands, and is
on the direct Oraibi trail from Shumopavi, 3&nbsp;miles from the latter. It
is a well dressed, rectangular block of sandstone, projecting two feet
above the ground, and measures 8½ by 7 inches. On the end is carved the
rude semblance of a human head, or mask, the eyes and mouth being merely
round shallow holes, with a black line painted around them. The stone is
pecked on the side, but the head and front are rubbed quite smooth, and
the block, tapering slightly to the base, suggests the ancient Roman
Termini.</p>

<p>There are Eagle people living at Oraibi, Mashongnavi, and Walpi, and
it would seem as if they had journeyed for some time with the later
Snake people and others from the northwest. Vague traditions attach them
to several of the ruins north of the Moen-kopi, although most of these
are regarded as the remains of Snake dwellings.</p>

<p>The legend of the Eagle people introduces them from the west, coming
in by way of the Moen-kopi water course. They found many people living
in Tusayan, at Oraibi, the Middle Mesa, and near the East Mesa, but the
Snake village was yet in the valley. Some of the Eagles remained at
Oraibi, but the main body moved to a large mound just east of
Mashongnavi, on the summit of which they built a village and called it
Shi-tái-mu. Numerous traces of small-roomed houses can be seen on this
mound and on some of the lower surroundings. The uneven summit is about
300 by 200 feet, and the village seems to have been built in the form of
an irregular ellipse, but the ground plan is very obscure.</p>

<p>While the Eagles were living at Shi-tái-mu, they sent “Yellow Foot”
to the mountain in the east (at&nbsp;the headwaters of the Rio Grande) to
obtain a dog. After many perilous adventures in caverns guarded by bear,
mountain lion, and rattlesnake, he got two dogs and returned.
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page029" id = "page029"> </a>
<!--png 083-->
They were wanted to keep the coyotes out of the corn and the gardens.
The dogs grew numerous, and would go to Mashongnavi in search of food,
and also to some of the people of that village, which led to serious
quarrels between them and the Eagle people. Ultimately the Shi-tái-mu
chief proclaimed a feast, and told the people to prepare to leave the
village forever. On the feast day the women arranged the food basins on
the ground in a long line leading out of the village. The people passed
along this line, tasting a mouthful here or there, but without stopping,
and when they reached the last basin they were beyond the limits of the
village. Without turning around they continued on down into the valley
until they were halted by the Snake people. An arrangement was effected
with the latter, and the Eagles built their houses in the Snake village.
A few of the Eagle families who had become attached to Mashongnavi chose
to go to that village, where their descendants still reside, and are yet
held as close relatives by the Eagles of Walpi. The land around the East
Mesa was then portioned out, the Snakes, Horns, Bears, and Eagles each
receiving separate lands, and these old allotments are still
approximately maintained.</p>

<p>According to the Eagle traditions the early occupants of Tusayan came
in the following succession: Snake, Horn, Bear, Middle Mesa, Oraibi, and
Eagle, and finally from the south came the Water families. This sequence
is also recognized in the general tenor of the legends of the other
groups.</p>

<p>Shupaulovi, a&nbsp;small village quite close to Mashongnavi, would seem to
have been established just before the coming of the Water people. Nor
does there seem to have been any very long interval between the arrival
of the earliest occupants of the Middle Mesa and this latest colony.
These were the Sun people, and like the Squash folk, claim to have come
from Palátkwabi, the Red Land, in the south. On their northward
migration, when they came to the valley of the Colorado Chiquito, they
found the Water people there, with whom they lived for some time. This
combined village was built upon Homólobi, a&nbsp;round terraced mound near
Sunset Crossing, where fragmentary ruins covering a wide area can yet be
traced.</p>

<p>Incoming people from the east had built the large village of Awatubi,
high rock, upon a steep mesa about nine miles southeast from Walpi. When
the Sun people came into Tusayan they halted at that village and a few
of them remained there permanently, but the others continued west to the
Middle Mesa. At that time also they say Chukubi, Shitaimu, Mashongnavi,
and the Squash village on the terrace were all occupied, and they built
on the terrace close to the Squash village also. The Sun people were
then very numerous and soon spread their dwellings over the summit where
the ruin now stands, and many indistinct lines of house walls around
this dilapidated village attest its former size. Like the neighboring
village, it takes its name from a rock near by,
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page030" id = "page030"> </a>
<!--png 084-->
which is used as a place for the deposit of votive offerings, but the
etymology of the term can not be traced.</p>

<p>Some of the Bear people also took up their abode at Shupaulovi, and
later a nyumu of the Water family called Batni, moisture, built with
them; and the diminished families of the existing village are still
composed entirely of these three nyumu.</p>

<p>The next arrivals seem to have been the Asanyumu, who in early days
lived in the region of the Chama, in New Mexico, at a village called
Kaékibi, near the place now known as Abiquiu. When they left that region
they moved slowly westward to a place called Túwii (Santo Domingo),
where some of them are said to still reside. The next halt was at
Kaiwáika (Laguna) where it is said some families still remain, and they
staid also a short time at A´ikoka (Acoma); but none of them remained at
that place. From the latter place they went to Sióki (Zuñi), where they
remained a long time and left a number of their people there, who are
now called Aiyáhokwi by the Zuñi. They finally reached Tusayan by way of
Awatubi. They had been preceded from the same part of New Mexico by the
Honan nyumu (the Badger people), whom they found living at the
last-named village. The Magpie, the Pute Kóhu (Boomerang-shaped hunting
stick), and the Field-mouse families of the Asa remained and built
beside the Badger, but the rest of its groups continued across to the
Walpi Mesa. They were not at first permitted to come up to Walpi, which
then occupied its present site, but were allotted a place to build at
Coyote Water, a&nbsp;small spring on the east side of the mesa, just under
the gap. They had not lived there very long, however, when for some
valuable services in defeating at one time a raid of the Ute (who used
to be called the Tcingawúptuh) and of the Navajo at another, they were
given for planting grounds all the space on the mesa summit from the gap
to where Sichumovi now stands, and the same width, extending across the
valley to the east. On the mesa summit they built the early portion of
the house mass on the north side of the village, now known as Hano. But
soon after this came a succession of dry seasons, which caused a great
scarcity of food almost amounting to a famine, and many moved away to
distant streams. The Asa people went to Túpkabi (Deep Canyon, the de
Chelly), about 70 miles northeast from Walpi, where the Navajo received
them kindly and supplied them with food. The Asa had preserved some
seeds of the peach, which they planted in the canyon nooks, and numerous
little orchards still flourish there. They also brought the Navajo new
varieties of food plants, and their relations grew very cordial. They
built houses along the base of the canyon walls, and dwelt there for two
or three generations, during which time many of the Asa women were given
to the Navajo, and the descendants of these now constitute a numerous
clan among the Navajo, known as the Kiáini, the High-house people.</p>

<p>The Navajo and the Asa eventually quarreled and the latter returned
to Walpi, but this was after the arrival of the Hano, by whom they
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page031" id = "page031"> </a>
<!--png 087-->
found their old houses occupied. The Asa were taken into the village of
Walpi, being given a vacant strip on the east edge of the mesa, just
where the main trail comes up to the village. The Navajo, Ute, and
Apache had frequently gained entrance to the village by this trail, and
to guard it the Asa built a house group along the edge of the cliff at
that point, immediately overlooking the trail, where some of the people
still live; and the kiva there, now used by the Snake order, belongs to
them. There was a crevice in the rock, with a smooth bottom extending to
the edge of the cliff and deep enough for a ki´koli. A&nbsp;wall was built to
close the outer edge and it was at first intended to build a dwelling
house there, but it was afterward excavated to its present size and made
into a kiva, still called the wikwálhobi, the kiva of the Watchers of
the High Place. The Walpi site becoming crowded, some of the Bear and
Lizard people moved out and built houses on the site of the present
Sichumovi; several Asa families followed them, and after them came some
of the Badger people. The village grew to an extent considerably beyond
its present size, when it was abandoned on account of a malignant
plague. After the plague, and within the present generation, the village
was rebuilt&mdash;the old houses being torn down to make the new
ones.</p>

<p>After the Asa came the nest group to arrive was the Water family.
Their chief begins the story of their migration in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
In the long ago the Snake, Horn, and Eagle people lived here (in&nbsp;Tusayan),
but their corn grew only a span high, and when they sang for
rain the cloud god sent only a thin mist. My people then lived in the
distant Pa-lát Kwá-bi in the South. There was a very bad old man there,
who, when he met any one, would spit in his face, blow his nose upon
him, and rub ordure upon him. He ravished the girls and did all manner
of evil. Baholikonga got angry at this and turned the world upside down,
and water spouted up through the kivas and through the fireplaces in the
houses. The earth was rent in great chasms, and water covered everything
except one narrow ridge of mud; and across this the serpent deity told
all the people to travel. As they journeyed across, the feet of the bad
slipped and they fell into the dark water, but the good, after many
days, reached dry land. While the water was rising around the village
the old people got on the tops of the houses, for they thought they
could not struggle across with the younger people; but Baholikonga
clothed them with the skins of turkeys, and they spread their wings out
and floated in the air just above the surface of the water, and in this
way they got across. There were saved of our people Water, Corn, Lizard,
Horned Toad, Sand, two families of Rabbit, and Tobacco. The turkey tail
dragged in the water&mdash;hence the white on the turkey tail now.
Wearing these turkey-skins is the reason why old people have dewlaps
under the chin like a turkey; it is also the reason why old people use
turkey-feathers at the religious ceremonies.</blockquote>

<p>In the story of the wandering of the Water people, many vague
references are made to various villages in the South, which they
constructed or dwelt in, and to rocks where they carved their totems at
temporary halting places. They dwelt for a long time at Homólobi, where
the Sun people joined them; and probably not long after the latter left
the Water people followed on after them. The largest number of this
family seem
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page032" id = "page032"> </a>
<!--png 088-->
to have made their dwellings first at Mashongnavi and Shupaulovi; but
like the Sun people they soon spread to all the villages.</p>

<p>The narrative of part of this journey is thus given by the chief
before quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
It occupied 4 years to cross the disrupted country. The kwakwanti
(a&nbsp;warrior order) went ahead of the people and carried seed of
corn, beans, melons, squashes, and cotton. They would plant corn in the
mud at early morning and by noon it was ripe and thus the people were
fed. When they reached solid ground they rested, and then they built
houses. The kwakwanti were always out exploring&mdash;sometimes they
were gone as long as four years. Again we would follow them on long
journeys, and halt and build houses and plant. While we were traveling
if a woman became heavy with child we would build her a house and put
plenty of food in it and leave her there, and from these women sprang
the Pima, Maricopa, and other Indians in the South.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Away in the South, before we crossed the mountains (south of the Apache
country) we built large houses and lived there a long while. Near these
houses is a large rock on which was painted the rain-clouds of the Water
phratry, also a man carrying corn in his arms; and the other phratries
also painted the Lizard and the Rabbit upon it. While they were living
there the kwakwanti made an expedition far to the north and came in
conflict with a hostile people. They fought day after day, for days and
days&mdash;they fought by day only and when night came they separated,
each party retiring to its own ground to rest. One night the cranes came
and each crane took a kwakwanti on his back and brought them back to
their people in the South.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Again all the people traveled north until they came to the Little
Colorado, near San Francisco Mountains, and there they built houses up
and down the river. They also made long ditches to carry the water from
the river to their gardens. After living there a long while they began
to be plagued with swarms of a kind of gnat called the sand-fly, which
bit the children, causing them to swell up and die. The place becoming
unendurable, they were forced again to resume their travels. Before
starting, one of the Rain-women, who was big with child, was made
comfortable in one of the houses on the mountain. She told her people to
leave her, because she knew this was the place where she was to remain
forever. She also told them, that hereafter whenever they should return
to the mountain to hunt she would provide them with plenty of game.
Under her house is a spring and any sterile woman who drinks of its
water will bear children. The people then began a long journey to reach
the summit of the table land on the north. They camped for rest on one
of the terraces, where there was no water, and they were very tired and
thirsty. Here the women celebrated the rain-feast&mdash;they danced for
three days, and on the fourth day the clouds brought heavy rain and
refreshed the people. This event is still commemorated by a circle of
stones at that place. They reached a spring southeast from Káibitho
(Kumás Spring) and there they built a house and lived for some time. Our
people had plenty of rain and cultivated much corn and some of the Walpi
people came to visit us. They told ns that their rain only came here and
there in fine misty sprays, and a basketful of corn was regarded as a
large crop. So they asked us to come to their land and live with them
and finally we consented. When we got there we found some Eagle people
living near the Second Mesa; our people divided, and part went with the
Eagle and have ever since remained there; but we camped near the First
Mesa. It was planting time and the Walpi celebrated their rain-feast but
they brought only a mere misty drizzle. Then we celebrated our
rain-feast and planted. Great rains and thunder and lightning
immediately followed and on the first day after planting our corn was
half an arm’s length high; on the fourth day it was its full height, and
in one moon it was ripe. When we were going up to the village (Walpi was
then north of the gap, probably), we were met by a
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page033" id = "page033"> </a>
<!--png 091-->
Bear man who said that our thunder frightened the women and we must not
go near the village. Then the kwakwanti said, “Let us leave these people
and seek a land somewhere else,” but our women said they were tired of
travel and insisted upon our remaining. Then “Fire-picker” came down
from the village and told us to come up there and stay, but after we had
got into the village the Walpi women screamed out against us&mdash;they
feared our thunder&mdash;and so the Walpi turned us away. Then our
people, except those who went to the Second Mesa, traveled to the
northeast as far as the Tsegi (Canyon de Chelly), but I can not tell
whether our people built the louses there. Then they came hack to this
region again and built houses and had much trouble with the Walpi, but
we have lived here ever since.</blockquote>

<p>Groups of the Water people, as already stated, were distributed among
all the villages, although the bulk of them remained at the Middle Mesa;
but it seems that most of the remaining groups subsequently chose to
build their permanent houses at Oraibi. There is no special tradition of
this movement; it is only indicated by this circumstance, that in
addition to the Water families common to every village, there are still
in Oraibi several families of that people which have no representatives
in any of the other villages. At a quite early day Oraibi became a place
of importance, and they tell of being sufficiently populous to establish
many outlying settlements. They still identify these with ruins on the
detached mesas in the valley to the south and along the Moen-kopi
(“place of flowing water”) and other intermittent streams in the west.
These sites were occupied for the purpose of utilizing cultivable tracts
of land in their vicinity, and the remotest settlement, about 45 miles
west, was especially devoted to the cultivation of cotton, the place
being still called by the Navajo and other neighboring tribes, the
“cotton planting ground.” It is also said that several of the larger
ruins along the course of the Moen-kopi were occupied by groups of the
Snake, the Coyote, and the Eagle who dwelt in that region for a long
period before they joined the people in Tusayan. The incursions of
foreign bands from the north may have hastened that movement, and the
Oraibi say they were compelled to withdraw all their outlying colonies.
An episode is related of an attack upon the main village when a number
of young girls were carried off, and 2 or 3 years afterward the same
marauders returned and treated with the Oraibi, who paid a ransom in
corn and received all their girls back again. After a quiet interval the
pillaging bands renewed their attacks and the settlements on the
Moen-kopi were vacated. They were again occupied after another peace was
established, and this condition of alternate occupancy and abandonment
seems to have existed until within quite recent time.</p>

<p>While the Asa were still sojourning in Canyon de Chelly, and before
the arrival of the Hano, another bloody scene had been enacted in
Tusayan. Since the time of the Antelope Canyon feuds there had been
enmity between Awatubi and some of the other villages, especially Walpi,
and some of the Sikyatki refugees had transmitted their feudal wrongs to
their descendants who dwelt in Awatubi. They had long been perpetrating
all manner of offenses; they had intercepted hunting
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page034" id = "page034"> </a>
<!--png 092-->
parties from the other villages, seized their game, and sometimes killed
the hunters; they had fallen upon men in outlying corn fields,
maltreating and sometimes slaying them, and threatened still more
serious outrage. Awatubi was too strong for Walpi to attack
single-handed, so the assistance of the other villages was sought, and
it was determined to destroy Awatubi at the close of a feast soon to
occur. This was the annual “feast of the kwakwanti,” which is still
maintained and is held during the month of November by each village,
when the youths who have been qualified by certain ordeals are admitted
to the councils. The ceremonies last several days, and on the concluding
night special rites are held in the kivas. At these ceremonies every man
must be in the kiva to which he belongs, and after the close of the
rites they all sleep there, no one being permitted to leave the kiva
until after sunrise on the following day.</p>

<p>There was still some little intercourse between Awatubi and Walpi,
and it was easily ascertained when this feast was to be held. On the day
of its close, the Walpi sent word to their allies “to prepare the war
arrow and come,” and in the evening the fighting bands from the other
villages assembled at Walpi, as the foray was to be led by the chief of
that village. By the time night had fallen something like 150 marauders
had met, all armed, of course; and of still more ominous import than
their weapons were the firebrands they carried&mdash;shredded cedar bark
loosely bound in rolls, resinous splinters of piñon, dry greasewood
(a&nbsp;furze very easily ignited), and pouches full of pulverized red
peppers.</p>

<p>Secure in the darkness from observation, the bands followed the Walpi
chief across the valley, every man with his weapons in hand and a bundle
of inflammables on his back. Beaching the Awatubi mesa they cautiously
crept up the steep, winding trail to the summit, and then stole round
the village to the passages leading to the different courts holding the
kivas, near which they hid themselves. They waited till just before the
gray daylight came, then the Walpi chief shouted his war cry and the
yelling bands rushed to the kivas. Selecting their positions, they were
at them in a moment, and quickly snatching up the ladders through the
hatchways, the only means of exit, the doomed occupants were left as
helpless as rats in a trap. Fire was at hand in the numerous little
cooking pits, containing the jars of food prepared for the celebrants,
the inflammable bundles were lit and tossed into the kivas, and the
piles of firewood on the terraced roofs were thrown down upon the blaze,
and soon each kiva became a furnace. The red pepper was then cast upon
the fire to add its choking tortures, while round the hatchways the
assailants stood showering their arrows into the mass of struggling
wretches. The fires were maintained until the roofs fell in and buried
and charred the bones of the victims. It is said that every male of
Awatubi who had passed infancy perished in the slaughter, not one
escaping. Such of the women and children as were spared were taken out,
and all the houses were destroyed, after which the captives were divided
among the different villages.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">35</span>

<!--png 094-->
The date of this last feudal atrocity can be made out with some degree
of exactness, because in 1692, Don Diego Vargas with a military force
visited Tusayan and mentions Awatubi as a populous village at which he
made some halt. The Hano (Tewa) claim that they have lived in Tusayan
for five or six generations, and that when they arrived there was no
Awatubi in existence; hence it must have been destroyed not long after
the close of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Since the destruction of Awatubi only one other serious affray has
occurred between the villages; that was between Oraibi and Walpi. It
appears that after the Oraibi withdrew their colonies from the south and
west they took possession of all the unoccupied planting grounds to the
east of the village, and kept reaching eastward till they encroached
upon some land claimed by the Walpi. This gave rise to intermittent
warfare in the outlying fields, and whenever the contending villagers
met a broil ensued, until the strife culminated in an attack upon Walpi.
The Oraibi chose a day when the Walpi men were all in the field on the
east side of the mesa, but the Walpi say that their women and dogs held
the Oraibi at bay until the men came to the rescue. A&nbsp;severe battle was
fought at the foot of the mesa, in which the Oraibi were routed and
pursued across the Middle Mesa, where an Oraibi chief turned and
implored the Walpi to desist. A&nbsp;conciliation was effected there, and
harmonious relations have ever since existed between them. Until within
a few years ago the spot where they stayed pursuit was marked by a
stone, on which a shield and a dog were depicted, but it was a source of
irritation to the Oraibi and it was removed by some of the Walpi.</p>

<p>In the early part of the eighteenth century the Ute from the north,
and the Apache from the south made most disastrous inroads upon the
villages, in which Walpi especially suffered. The Navajo, who then lived
upon their eastern border, also suffered severely from the same bands,
but the Navajo and the Tusayan were not on the best terms and never made
any alliance for a common defense against these invaders.</p>

<p>Hano was peopled by a different linguistic stock from that of the
other villages&mdash;a stock which belongs to the Rio Grande group.
According to Polaka, the son of the principal chief, and himself an
enterprising trader who has made many journeys to distant
localities&mdash;and to others, the Hano once lived in seven villages on
the Rio Grande, and the village in which his forefathers lived was
called Tceewáge. This, it is said, is the same as the present Mexican
village of Peña Blanca.</p>

<p>The Hano claim that they came to Tusayan only after repeated
solicitation by the Walpi, at a time when the latter were much harassed
by the Ute and Apache. The story, as told by Kwálakwai, who lives in
Hano, but is not himself a Hano, begins as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has open quote">Long</ins> ago
the Hopi´tuh were few and were continually harassed by the Yútamo (Ute),
Yuíttcemo (Apache), and Dacábimo (Navajo). The chiefs of the Tcuin nyumu
(Snake people) and the Hánin nyumu (Bear people) met together and made
the ba´ho (sacred plume stick) and sent it with a man from each of these
people to the house of the Tewa, called Tceewádigi, which was far off on
the Múina (river) near Alavia (<ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Sante’">Santa</ins>&nbsp;Fé).</blockquote>

<p><span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page036" id = "page036"> </a>
<!--png 095-->
The messengers did not succeed in persuading the Tewa to come and the
embassy was sent three times more. On the fourth visit the Tewa
consented to come, as the Walpi had offered to divide their land and
their waters with them, and set out for Tusayan, led by their own chief,
the village being left in the care of his son. This first band is said
to have consisted of 146 women, and it was afterwards followed by
another and perhaps others.</p>

<p>Before the Hano arrived there had been a cessation of hostile
inroads, and the Walpi received them churlishly and revoked their
promises regarding the division of land and waters with them. They were
shown where they could build houses for themselves on a yellow sand
mound on the east side of the mesa just below the gap. They built there,
but they were compelled to go for their food up to Walpi. They could get
no vessels to carry their food in, and when they held out their hands
for some the Walpi women mockingly poured out hot porridge and scalded
the fingers of the Hano.</p>

<p>After a time the Ute came down the valley on the west side of the
mesa, doing great harm again, and drove off the Walpi flocks andiron
Then the Hano got ready for war; they tied buckskins around their loins,
whitened their legs with clay, and stained their body and arms with dark
red earth (ocher). They overtook the Ute near Wípho (about 3 miles north
from Hano), but the Ute had driven the flocks up the steep mesa side,
and when they saw the Tewa coming they killed all the sheep and piled
the carcasses up for a defense, behind which they lay down. They had a
few firearms also, while the Hano had only clubs and bows and arrows;
but after some fighting the Ute were driven out and the Tewa followed
after them. The first Ute was killed a short distance beyond, and a
stone heap still (?) marks the spot. Similar heaps marked the places
where other Ute were killed as they fled before the Hano, but not far
from the San Juan the last one was killed.</p>

<p>Upon the return of the Hano from this successful expedition they were
received gratefully and allowed to come up on the mesa to live&mdash;the
old houses built by the Asa, in the present village of Hano, being
assigned to them. The land was then divided, an imaginary line between
Hano and Sichumovi, extending eastward entirely across the valley,
marked the southern boundary, and from this line as far north as the
spot where the last Utah was killed was assigned to the Hano as their
possession.</p>

<blockquote>
When the Hano first came the Walpi said to them, “let us spit in your
mouths, and you will learn our tongue,” and to this the Hano consented.
When the Hano came up and built on the mesa they said to the Walpi, “let
us spit in your mouths and you will learn our tongue,” but the Walpi
would not listen to this, saying it would make them vomit. This is the
reason why all the Hano can talk Hopí, and none of the Hopítuh can talk
Hano.</blockquote>

<p>The Asa and the Hano were close friends while they dwelt in New
Mexico, and when they came to this region both of them were called
Hánomuh by the other people of Tusayan. This term signifies the mode in
which the women of these people wear their hair, cut off in front on a
line with
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page037" id = "page037"> </a>
<!--png 097-->
the mouth and carelessly parted or hanging over the face, the back hair
rolled up in a compact queue at the nape of the neck. This uncomely
fashion prevails with both matron, and maid, while among the other
Tusayan the matron parts her hair evenly down the head and wears it
hanging in a straight queue on either side, the maidens wearing theirs
in a curious discoid arrangement over each temple.</p>

<p>Although the Asa and the Hano women have the same peculiar fashion of
wearing the hair, still there is no affinity of blood claimed between
them. The Asa speak the same language as the other Tusayan, but the Tewa
(Hano) have a quite distinct language which belongs to the Tañoan stock.
They claim that the occupants of the following pueblos, in the same
region of the Rio Grande, are of their people and speak the same
tongue.</p>

<p>Pleasant relations existed for some time, but the Walpi again grew
ill-tempered; they encroached upon the Hano planting grounds and stole
their property. These troubles increased, and the Hano moved away from
the mesa; they crossed the west valley and built temporary shelters.
They sent some men to explore the land on the westward to find a
suitable place for a new dwelling. These scouts went to the Moen-kopi,
and on returning, the favorable story they told of the land they had
seen determined the Tewa to go there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some knowledge of these troubles had reached Tceewádigi,
and a party of the Tewa came to Tusayan to take their friends back. This
led the Hopituh to make reparation, which restored the confidence of the
Hano, and they returned to the mesa, and the recently arrived party were
also induced to remain. Yet even now, when the Hano (Tewa) go to visit
their people on the river, the latter beseech them to come back, but the
old Tewa say, “we shall stay here till our breath leaves us, then surely
we shall go back to our first home to live forever.”</p>

<p>The Walpi for a long time frowned down all attempts on the part of
the Hano to fraternize; they prohibited intermarriages, and in general
tabued the Hano. Something of this spirit was maintained until quite
recent years, and for this reason the Hano still speak their own
language, and have preserved several distinctive customs, although now
the most friendly relations exist among all the villages. After the Hano
were quietly established in their present position the Asa returned, and
the Walpi allotted them a place to build in their own village. As before
mentioned, the house mass on the southeast side of Walpi, at the head of
the trail leading up to the village at that point, is still occupied by
Asa families, and their tenure of possession was on the condition that
they should always defend that point of access and guard the south end

<!--png 098-->
of the village. Their kiva is named after this circumstance as that of
“the Watchers of the High Place.”</p>

<p>Some of the Bear and Lizard families being crowded for building
space, moved from Walpi and built the first houses on the site of the
present village of Sichumovi, which is named from the Sivwapsi, a&nbsp;shrub
which formerly grew there on some mounds (chumo).</p>

<p>This was after the Asa had been in Walpi for some time; probably
about 125 years ago. Some of the Asa, and the Badger, the latter
descendants of women saved from the Awatubi catastrophe, also moved to
Sichumovi, but a plague of smallpox caused the village to be abandoned
shortly afterward. This pestilence is said to have greatly reduced the
number of the Tusayan, and after it disappeared there were many vacant
houses in every village. Sichumovi was again occupied by a few Asa
families, but the first houses were torn down and new ones constructed
from them.</p>

LIST OF TRADITIONARY GENTES.</a></h5>

<p>In the following table the early phratries (nyu-mu) are arranged in
the order of their arrival, and the direction from which each came is
given, except in the case of the Bear people. There are very few
representatives of this phratry existing now, and very little tradition
extant concerning its early history. The table does not show the
condition of these, organizations in the present community but as they
appear in the traditional accounts of their coming to Tusayan, although
representatives of most of them can still be found in the various
villages. There are, moreover, in addition to these, many other gentes
and sub-gentes of more recent origin. The subdivision, or rather the
multiplication of gentes may be said to be a continuous process; as, for
example, in “corn” can be found families claiming to be of the root,
stem, leaf, ear, blossom, etc., all belonging to corn; but there may be
several families of each of these components constituting district
sub-gentes. At present there are really but four phratries recognized
among the Hopituh, the Snake, Horn, Eagle, and Rain, which is
indifferently designated as Water or Corn:</p>

SUPPLEMENTARY LEGEND.</a></h5>

<p>An interesting ruin which occurs on a mesa point a short distance
north of Mashongnavi is known to the Tusayan under the name of Payupki.
There are traditions and legends concerning it among the Tusayan, but
the only version that could be obtained is not regarded by the writer as
being up to the standard of those incorporated in the “Summary” and it
is therefore given separately, as it has some suggestive value. It was
obtained through Dr. Jeremiah Sullivan, then resident in Tusayan.</p>

<p>The people of Payupki spoke the same language as those on the first
mesa (Walpi). Long ago they lived in the north, on the San Juan, but
they were compelled to abandon that region and came to a place about 20
miles northwest from Oraibi. Being compelled to leave there, they went
to Canyon de Chelly, where a band of Indians from the southeast joined
them, with whom they formed an alliance. Together the two tribes moved
eastward toward the Jemez Mountains, whence they drifted into the valley
of the Rio Grande. There they became converts to the fire-worship then
prevailing, but retained their old customs and language. At the time of
the great insurrection (of&nbsp;1680) they sheltered the native priests that
were driven from some of the Rio Grande villages, and this action
created such distrust and hatred among the people that the Payupki were
forced to leave their settlement. Their first stop was at Old Laguna
(12&nbsp;miles east of the modern village) and they had with them then some 35 or
40 of the priests. After leaving Laguna they came to Bear Spring (Fort
Wingate) and had a fight there with the Apache, whom they defeated. They
remained at Bear Spring for several years, until the Zuñi compelled them
to move. They then attempted to reach the San Juan, but were deceived in
the trail, turned to the west and came to where Pueblo Colorado is now
(the present post-office of Ganado, between Fort Defiance and Keam’s
Canyon). They remained there a long time, and through their success in
farming became so favorably known that they were urged to come farther
west. They refused, in consequence of which some Tusayan attacked them.
They were captured and brought to Walpi (then on the point) and
afterwards they were distributed among the villages. Previous to this
capture the priests had been guiding them by feathers, smoke, and signs
seen in the fire. When the priest’s omens and oracles had proved false
the people were disposed to kill them, but the priests persuaded them to
let it depend on a test case&mdash;offering to kill themselves in the
event of failure. So they had a great feast at Awatubi. The priests had
long, hollow reeds inclosing various substances&mdash;feathers, flour,
corn-pollen, sacred water, native tobacco (piba), corn, beans, melon
seeds, etc., and they formed in a circle at sunrise on the plaza and had
their incantations and prayers. As the sun rose a priest stepped forth
before the people and blew through his reed, desirous of blowing
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page041" id = "page041"> </a>
<!--png 105-->
that which was therein away from him, to scatter it abroad. But the wind
would not blow and the contents of the reed fell to the ground. The
priests were divided into groups, according to what they carried. In the
evening all but two groups had blown. Then the elder of the twain turned
his back eastward, and the reed toward the setting sun, and he blew, and
the wind caught the feather and carried it to the west. This was
accepted as a sign and the next day the Tusayan freed the slaves, giving
each a blanket with corn in it. They went to the mesa where the ruin now
stands and built the houses there. They asked for planting grounds, and
fields were given them; but their crops did not thrive, and they stole
corn from the Mashongnavi. Then, fearful lest they should be surprised
at night, they built a wall as high as a man’s head about the top of
their mesa, and they had big doorways, which they closed and fastened at
night. When they were compelled to plant corn for themselves they
planted it on the ledges of the mesa, but it grew only as high as a
man’s knees; the leaves were very small and the grains grew only on one
side of it. After a time they became friendly with the Mashongnavi
again, and a boy from that village conceived a passion for a Payupki
girl. The latter tribe objected to a marriage but the Mashongnavi were
very desirous for it and some warriors of that village proposed if the
boy could persuade the girl to fly with him, to aid and protect him. On
an appointed day, about sundown, the girl came down from the mesa into
the valley, but she was discovered by some old women who were baking
pottery, who gave the alarm. Hearing the noise a party of the
Mashongnavi, who were lying in wait, came up, but they encountered a
party of the Payupki who had come out and a fight ensued. During the
fight the young man was killed; and this caused so much bitterness of
feeling that the Payupki were frightened, and remained quietly in their
pueblo for several days. One morning, however, an old woman came over to
Mashongnavi to borrow some tobacco, saying that they were going to have
a dance in her village in five days. The next day the Payupki quietly
departed. Seeing no smoke from the village the Mashongnavi at first
thought that the Payupki were preparing for their dance, but on the
third day a band of warriors was sent over to inquire and they found the
village abandoned. The estufas and the houses of the priests were pulled
down.</p>

<p>The narrator adds that the Payupki returned to San Felipe whence they
came.</p>

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE PROVINCE.</a></h5>

<p>That portion of the southwestern plateau country comprised in the
Province of Tusayan has usually been approached from the east, so that
the easternmost of the series of mesas upon which the villages are
situated is called the “First Mesa.” The road for 30 or 40 miles before
reaching this point traverses the eastern portion of the great plateau
whose broken margin, farther west, furnishes the abrupt mesa-tongues
upon which the villages are built. The sandstone measures of this
plateau are distinguished from many others of the southwest by their
neutral colors. The vegetation consisting of a scattered growth of
stunted piñon and cedar, interspersed with occasional stretches of
dull-gray sage, imparts an effect of extreme monotony to the landscape.
The effect is in marked contrast to the warmth and play of color
frequently seen elsewhere in the plateau country.</p>

<p>The plateaus of Tusayan are generally diversified by canyons and
buttes, whose precipitous sides break down into long ranges of rocky
talus and sandy foothills. The arid character of this district is
especially pronounced about the margin of the plateau. In the immediate
vicinity of the villages there are large areas that do not support a
blade of grass, where barren rocks outcrop through drifts of sand or lie
piled in confusion at the bases of the cliffs. The canyons that break
through the margins of these mesas often have a remarkable similarity of
appearance, and the consequent monotony is extremely embarrassing to the
traveler, the absence of running water and clearly defined drainage
confusing his sense of direction.</p>

<p>The occasional springs which furnish scanty water supply to the
inhabitants of this region are found generally at great distances apart,
and there are usually but few natural indications of their location.
They often occur in obscure nooks in the canyons, reached by tortuous
trails winding through the talus and foothills, or as small seeps at the
foot of some mesa. The convergence of numerous Navajo trails, however,
furnishes some guide to these rare water sources.</p>

<p>The series of promontories upon which the Tusayan villages are built
are exceptionally rich in these seeps and springs. About the base of
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page043" id = "page043"> </a>
<!--png 108-->
the “First Mesa” (Fig.&nbsp;1), within a distance
of 4 or 5 miles from the villages located upon it, there are at least
five places where water can be obtained. One of these is a mere surface
reservoir, but the others appear to be permanent springs. The quantity
of water, however, is so small that it produces no impression on the
arid and sterile effect of the surroundings, except in its immediate
vicinity. Here small patches of green, standing out in strong relief
against their sandy back-grounds, mark the position of clusters of low,
stunted peach trees that have obtained a foothold on the steep sand
dunes.</p>

View of the First Mesa.</p>

<p>In the open plains surrounding the mesa rim (6,000 feet above the
sea), are seen broad stretches of dusty sage brush and prickly
greasewood. Where the plain rises toward the base of the mesa a
scattered growth of scrub cedar and piñon begins to appear. But little
of this latter growth is seen in the immediate vicinity of the villages;
it is, however, the characteristic vegetation of the mesas, while, in
still higher altitudes, toward the San Juan, open forests of timber are
met with. This latter country seems scarcely to have come within the
ancient builder’s province; possibly on account of its coldness in
winter and for the reason that it is open to the incursions of warlike
hunting tribes. Sage brush and greasewood grow abundantly near the
villages, and these curious gnarled and twisted shrubs furnish the
principal fuel of the Tusayan.</p>

<p>Occasionally grassy levels are seen that for a few weeks in early
summer are richly carpeted with multitudes of delicate wild flowers. The
beauty of these patches of gleaming color is enhanced by contrast with
the forbidding and rugged character of the surroundings; but in a very
short time these blossoms disappear from the arid and parched desert
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page044" id = "page044"> </a>
<!--png 109-->
that they have temporarily beautified. These beds of bloom are not seen
in the immediate vicinity of the present villages, but are unexpectedly
met with in portions of the neighboring mesas and canyons.</p>

<p>After crossing the 6 or 7 miles of comparatively level country that
intervenes between the mouth of Keam’s Canyon and the first of the
occupied mesas, the toilsome ascent begins; at first through slopes and
dunes and then over masses of broken talus, as the summit of the mesa is
gradually approached. Near the top the road is flanked on one side by a
very abrupt descent of broken slopes, and on the other by a precipitous
rocky wall that rises 30 or 40 feet above. The road reaches the brink of
the promontory by a sharp rise at a point close to the village of
Hano.</p>

METHODS OF SURVEY.</a></h5>

<p>Before entering upon a description of the villages and ruins, a&nbsp;few
words as to the preparation of the plans accompanying this paper will
not be amiss. The methods pursued in making the surveys of the inhabited
pueblos were essentially the same throughout. The outer wall of each
separate cluster was run with a compass and a tape measure, the lines
being closed and checked upon the corner from which the beginning was
made, so that the plan of each group stands alone, and no accumulation
of error is possible. The stretched tapeline afforded a basis for
estimating any deviations from a straight line which the wall presented,
and as each sight was plotted on the spot these deviations are all
recorded on the plan, and afford an indication of the degree of accuracy
with which the building was carried out. Upon the basis thus obtained,
the outlines of the second stories were drawn by the aid of measurements
from the numerous jogs and angles; the same process being repeated for
each of the succeeding stories. The plan at this stage recorded all the
stories in outline. The various houses and clusters were connected by
compass sights and by measurements. A&nbsp;tracing of the outline plan was
then made, on which the stories were distinguished by lines of different
colors, and upon this tracing were recorded all the vertical
measurements. These were generally taken at every corner, although in a
long wall it was customary to make additional measurements at
intervening points.</p>

<p>Upon the original outline were then drawn all such details as coping
stones, chimneys, trapdoors, etc., the tapeline being used where
necessary to establish positions. The forms of the chimneys as well as
their position and size were also indicated on this drawing, which was
finally tinted to distinguish the different terraces. Upon this colored
sheet were located all openings. These were numbered, and at the same
time described in a notebook, in which were also recorded the necessary
vertical measurements, such as their height and elevation above the
ground. In the same notebook the openings were also fully described. The
ladders were located upon the same sheet, and were consecutively
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page045" id = "page045"> </a>
<!--png 112-->
lettered and described in the notebook. This description furnishes a
record of the ladder, its projection above the coping, if any, the
difference in the length of its poles, the character of the tiepiece,
etc. Altogether these notebooks furnish a mass of statistical data which
has been of great service in the elaboration of this report and in the
preparation of models. Finally, a&nbsp;level was carried over the whole
village, and the height of each corner and jog above an assumed base was
determined. A&nbsp;reduced tracing was then made of the plan as a basis for
sketching in such details of topography, etc., as it was thought
advisable to preserve.</p>

<p>These plans were primarily intended to be used in the construction of
large scale models, and consequently recorded an amount of information
that could not be reproduced upon the published drawings without causing
great confusion.</p>

<p>The methods followed in surveying the ruins underwent some changes
from time to time as the work progressed. In the earlier work the lines
of the walls, so far as they could be determined, were run with a
compass and tapeline and gone over with a level. Later it was found more
convenient to select a number of stations and connect them by
cross-sights and measurements. These points were then platted, and the
walls and lines of débris were carefully drawn in over the framework of
lines thus obtained, additional measurements being taken when necessary.
The heights of standing walls were measured from both sides, and
openings were located on the plan and described in a notebook, as was
done in the survey of the inhabited villages. The entire site was then
leveled, and from the data obtained contour lines were drawn with a
5-foot interval. Irregularities in the directions of walls were noted.
In the later plans of ruins a scale of symbols, seven in number, were
employed to indicate the amount and distribution of the débris. The
plans, as published, indicate the relative amounts of débris as seen
upon the ground. Probable lines of wall are shown on the plan by dotted
lines drawn through the dots which indicate débris. With this exception,
the plans show the ruins as they actually are. Standing walls, as a
rule, are drawn in solid black; their heights appear on the field
sheets, but could not be shown upon the published plans without
confusing the drawing. The contour lines represent an interval of 5
feet; the few cases in which the secondary or negative contours are used
will not produce confusion, as their altitude is always given in
figures.</p>

PLANS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF RUINS.</a></h5>

<p>The ruins described in this chapter comprise but a few of those found
within the province of Tusayan. These were surveyed and recorded on
account of their close traditional connection with the present villages,
and for the sake of the light that they might throw upon the relation of
the modern pueblos to the innumerable stone buildings of unknown date so
widely distributed over the southwestern plateau country. Such
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page046" id = "page046"> </a>
<!--png 113-->
traditional connection with the present peoples could probably be
established for many more of the ruins of this country by investigations
similar to those conducted by Mr. Stephen in the Tusayan group; but this
phase of the subject was not included in our work. In the search for
purely architectural evidence among these ruins it must be confessed
that the data have proved disappointingly meager. No trace of the
numerous constructive details that interest the student of pueblo
architecture in the modern villages can be seen in the low mounds of
broken down masonry that remain in most of the ancient villages of
Tusayan. But little masonry remains standing in even the best preserved
of these ruins, and villages known to have been occupied within two
centuries are not distinguishable from the remains to which distinct
tradition (save that they were in the same condition when the first
people of the narrators’ gens came to this region) no longer clings.
Though but little architectural information is to be derived from these
ruins beyond such as is conveyed by the condition and character of the
masonry and the general distribution of the plan, the plans and relation
to the topography are recorded as forming, in connection with the
traditions, a&nbsp;more complete account than can perhaps be obtained
later.</p>

<p>In our study of architectural details, when a comparison is suggested
between the practice at Tusayan and that of the ancient builders, our
illustrations for the latter must often be drawn from other portions of
the builders’ territory where better preserved remains furnish the
necessary data.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_1" id = "chapII_3_1">
WALPI RUINS.</a></h6>

<p>In the case of the pueblo of Walpi, a&nbsp;portion of whose people seem to
have been the first comers in this region, a&nbsp;number of changes of sites
have taken place, at least one of which has occurred within the historic
period. Of the various sites occupied one is pointed out north of the
gap on the first mesa. At the present time this site is only a low mound
of sand-covered débris with no standing fragment of wall visible. The
present condition of this early Walpi is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;2.
In the absence of foundation walls or other definite
lines, the character of the site is expressed by the contour lines that
define its relief. Another of the sites occupied by the Walpi is said to
have been in the open valley separating the first from the second mesa,
but here no trace of the remains of a stone village has been discovered.
This traditional location is referred to by Mr. Stephen in his account
of Walpi. The last site occupied previous to the present one on the mesa
summit was on a lower bench of the first mesa promontory at its southern
extremity. Here the houses are said to have been distributed over quite
a large area, and occasional fragments of masonry are still seen at
widely separated points; but the ground plan can not now be traced. This
was the site of a Spanish mission, and some of the Tusayan point out the
position formerly occupied by mission buildings, but no architectural
evidence of such structures is visible. It seems to be fairly certain,
however, that
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page047" id = "page047"> </a>
<!--png 115-->
this was the site of Walpi at a date well within the historic period,
although now literally there is not one stone upon another. The
destruction in this instance has probably been more than usually
complete on account of the close proximity of the succeeding pueblo,
making the older remains a very convenient stone quarry for the
construction of the houses on the mesa summit. Of the three abandoned
sites of Walpi referred to, not one furnishes sufficient data for a
suggestion of a ground plan or of the area covered.</p>

OLD MASHONGNAVI.</a></h6>

<p>In the case of Mashongnavi we have somewhat more abundant material.
It will be desirable to quote a few lines of narrative from the account
of a Mashongnavi Indian of the name of Nuvayauma, as indicating the
causes that led to the occupation of the site illustrated.</p>

<blockquote>
We turned and came to the north, meeting the Apache and “Beaver
Indians,” with whom we had many battles, and being few we were defeated,
after which we came
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page048" id = "page048"> </a>
<!--png 116-->
up to Mashongnavi [the ruin at the “Giant’s Chair”] and gave that rock
its name [name not known], and built our houses there. The Apache came
upon us again, with the Comanche, and then we came to [Old Mashóngnavi].
We lived there in peace many years, having great success with crops, and
our people increased in numbers, and the Apache came in great numbers
and set fire to the houses and burned our corn, which you will find
to-day there burnt and charred. After they had destroyed our dwellings
we came upon the mesa, and have lived here since.</blockquote>

<p>The ruins referred to as having been the first occupied by the
Mashongnavi at a large isolated rock known as the “Giant’s Chair,” have
not been examined. The later village from which they were driven by the
attacks of the Apache to their present site has been surveyed. The plan
of the fallen walls and lines of débris by which the form of much of the
old pueblo can still be traced is given in <a href = "#plateII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">II</span></a>. The plan of the best preserved
portion of the pueblo towards the north end of the sheet clearly
indicates a general adherence to the inclosed court arrangement with
about the same degree of irregularity that characterizes the modern
village. Besides the clearly traceable portions of the ruin that bear
such resemblance to the present village in arrangement, several small
groups and clusters appear to have been scattered along the slope of the
foothills, but in their present state of destruction it is not clear
whether these clusters were directly connected with the principal group,
or formed part of another village. Occasional traces of foundation walls
strongly suggest such connection, although from the character of the
site this intervening space could hardly have been closely built over.
With the exception of the main cluster above described the houses occupy
very broken and irregular sites. As indicated on the plan, the slope is
broken by huge irregular masses of sandstone protruding from the soil,
while much of the surface is covered by scattered fragments that have
fallen from neighboring pinnacles and ledges. The contours indicate the
general character of the slopes over which these irregular features are
disposed. The fragment of ledge shown on the north end of the plate,
against which a part of the main cluster has been built, is a portion of
a broad massive ledge of sandstone that supports the low buttes upon
which the present villages of Mashongnavi and Shupaúlovi are built, and
continues as a broad, level shelf of solid rock for several miles along
the mesa promontory. Its continuation on the side opposite that shown in
the plate may be seen in the general view of Shupaulovi (<a href =
"#plateXXXI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXI</span></a>).</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_3" id = "chapII_3_3">
SHITAIMUVI.</a></h6>

<p>The vestiges of another ruined village, known as Shitaimuvi, are
found in the vicinity of Mashongnavi, occupying and covering the crown
of a rounded foothill on the southeast side of the mesa. No plan of this
ruin could be obtained on account of the complete destruction of the
walls. No line of foundation stones even could be found, although the
whole area is more or less covered with the scattered stones of former
masonry. An exceptional quantity of pottery fragments is also strewn
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page049" id = "page049"> </a>
<!--png 119-->
over the surface. These bear a close resemblance to the fine class of
ware characteristic of “Talla Hogan” or “Awatubi,” and would suggest
that this pueblo was contemporaneous with the latter. Some reference to
this ruin win be found in the traditionary material in Chapter <span
class = "smallroman">I</span>.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_4" id = "chapII_3_4">
AWATUBI.</a></h6>

<p>The ruin of Awatubi is known to the Navajo as Talla Hogan, a&nbsp;term
interpreted as meaning “singing house” and thought to refer to the
chapel and mission that at one time nourished here, as described by Mr.
Stephen in Chapter <span class = "smallroman">I</span>. Tradition
ascribes great importance to this village. At the time of the Spanish
conquest it was one of the most prosperous of the seven “cities” of
Tusayan, and was selected as the site of a mission, a&nbsp;distinction shared
by Walpi, which was then on a lower spur of the first mesa, and by
Shumopavi, which also was built on a lower site than the present village
of that name. Traditions referring to this pueblo have been collected
from several sources and, while varying somewhat in less important
details, they all concur in bringing the destruction of the village well
within the period of Spanish occupation.</p>

Plate IV. Awatubi (Talla-Hogan), plan.</p>

<p>On the historical site, too, we know that Cruzate on the occasion of
the attempted reconquest of the country visited this village in 1692,
and the ruin must therefore be less than two centuries old, yet the
completeness of destruction is such that over most of its area no
standing wall is seen, and the outlines of the houses and groups are
indicated mainly by low ridges and masses of broken-down masonry, partly
covered by the drifting sands. The group of rooms that forms the south
east side of the pueblo is an exception to the general rule. Here
fragmentary walls of rough masonry stand to a height, in some cases, of
8 feet above the débris. The character of the stonework, as may be seen
from Pl. <span class = "smallroman">V</span>, is
but little better than that of the modern villages. This better
preserved portion of the village seems to have formed part of a cluster
of mission buildings. At the points designated A on the ground plan may
be seen the remnants of walls that have been built of straw adobe in the
typical Spanish manner. These rest upon foundations of stone masonry.
See <a href = "#plateVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">VI</span></a>.
The adobe fragments are probably part of the church or associated
buildings. At two other points on the ground plan, both on the northeast
side, low fragments of wall are still standing, as may be seen from the
plate. At one of these points the remains indicate that the village was
provided with a gateway near the middle of the northeast side.</p>

Plate V. Standing walls of Awatubi.</p>

<p>The general plan of this pueblo is quite different from that of the
present villages, and approaches the older types in symmetry and
compactness. There is a notable absence of the arrangement of rooms into
long parallel rows. This typical Tusayan feature is only slightly
approximated in some subordinate rows within the court. The plan
suggests that the original pueblo was built about three sides of a
rectangular
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page050" id = "page050"> </a>
<!--png 120-->
court, the fourth or southeast side&mdash;later occupied by the mission
buildings&mdash;being left open, or protected only by a low wall.
Outside the rectangle of the main pueblo, on the northeast side, are two
fragments of rude masonry, built by Navajo sheep herders. Near the west
corner of the pueblo are the vestiges of two rooms, outside the pueblo
proper, which seem to belong to the original construction.</p>

Plate VI. Adobe fragment in Awatubi.</p>

<p>Awatubi is said to have had excavated rectangular kivas, situated in
the open court, similar to those used in the modern village. The people
of Walpi had partly cleared out one of these chambers and used it as a
depository for ceremonial plume-sticks, etc., but the Navajo came and
carried off their sacred deposits, tempted probably by their market
value as ethnologic specimens. No trace of these kivas was visible at
the time the ruins were surveyed.</p>

<p>The Awatubi are said to have had sheep at the time the village was
destroyed. Some of the Tusayan point out the remains of a large sheep
corral near the spring, which they say was used at that time, but it is
quite as likely to have been constructed for that purpose at a much
later date.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_5" id = "chapII_3_5">
HORN HOUSE.</a></h6>

<p>The Horn House is so called because tradition connects this village
with some of the people of the Horn phratry of the Hopituh or Tusayan.
The ruin is situated on a projecting point of the mesa that forms the
western flank of Jeditoh Valley, not far from where the Holbrook road to
Keam’s Canyon ascends the brink of the mesa. The village is almost
completely demolished, no fragment of standing wall remaining in place.
Its general plan and distribution are quite clearly indicated by the
usual low ridges of fallen masonry partly covered by drifted sand. There
is but little loose stone scattered about, the sand having filled in all
the smaller irregularities.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the plan, Pl. <span class
= "smallroman">VII</span>, that the village has been built close to
the edge of the mesa, following to some extent the irregularities of its
outline. The mesa ruin at this point, however, is not very high, the
more abrupt portion having a height of 20 or 30 feet. Near the north end
of the village the ground slopes very sharply toward the east and is
rather thickly covered with the small stones of fallen masonry, though
but faint vestiges of rooms remain. In plan the ruin is quite elongated,
following the direction of the mesa. The houses were quite irregularly
disposed, particularly in the northern portion of the ruin. But here the
indications are too vague to determine whether the houses were
originally built about one long court or about two or more smaller ones.
The south end of the pueblo, however, still shows a well defined court
bounded on all sides by clearly traceable rooms. At the extreme south
end of the ruin the houses have very irregular outlines, a&nbsp;result of
their adaptation to the topography, as may be seen in the
illustration.</p>

village. These trees indicate the proximity of water, and mark the
probable site of the spring that furnished this village with at least
part of its water supply.</p>

<p>There are many fragments of pottery on this spot, but they are not so
abundant as at Awatubi.</p>

<p>Two partly excavated rooms were seen at this ruin, the work of some
earlier visitors who hoped to discover ethnologic or other treasure.</p>

<p>These afforded no special information, as the character of the
masonry exposed differed in no respect from that seen at other of the
Tusayan ruins. No traces of adobe construction or suggestions of foreign
influence were seen at this ruin.</p>

SMALL RUIN BETWEEN HORN HOUSE AND BAT HOUSE.</a></h6>

<p>On a prolongation of the mesa occupied by the Horn House, midway
between it and another ruined pueblo known as the Bat House, occur the
remains of a small and compact cluster of houses (Fig.&nbsp;3).
It is situated on the very mesa edge, here
about 40 feet high, at the head of a small canyon which opens into the
Jeditoh Valley, a&nbsp;quarter of a mile below.</p>

Ruin between Bat House and Horn House.</p>

<p>The site affords an extended outlook to the south over a large part
of Jeditoh Valley. The topography about this point, which receives the
drainage of a considerable area of the mesa top, would fit it especially
for the establishment of a reservoir. This fact probably had much
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page052" id = "page052"> </a>
<!--png 124-->
to do with its selection as a dwelling site. The masonry is in about the
same state of preservation as that of the Horn House, and some of the
stones of the fallen walls seem to have been washed down from the mesa
edge to the talus below.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_7" id = "chapII_3_7">
BAT HOUSE.</a></h6>

<p>The Bat House is a ruin of nearly the same size as the Horn House,
although in its distribution it does not follow the mesa edge so closely
as the latter, and is not so elongated in its general form. The northern
portion is quite irregular, and the rooms seem to have been somewhat
crowded. The southern half, with only an occasional room traceable, as
indicated on the plan, Pl. <span class =

distributed about a large open court.</p>

Plate VIII. Bat House.</p>

<p>The Bat House is situated on the northwest side of the Jeditoh
Valley, on part of the same mesa occupied by the two ruins described
above. It occupies the summit of a projecting spur, overlooking the main
valley for an extent of more than 5 miles. The ruin lies on the extreme
edge of the cliff, here about 200 feet high, and lying beneath it on the
east and south are large areas of arable land. Altogether it forms an
excellent defensive site, combined with a fair degree of convenience to
fields and water from the Tusayan point of view.</p>

<p>This ruin, near its northeastern extremity, contains a feature that
is quite foreign to the architecture of Tusayan, viz, a&nbsp;defensive wall.
It is the only instance of the use by the Hopituh of an inclosing wall,
though it is met with again at Payupki (<a href = "#plateXIII">Pl. <span

<p>This village is rather more irregular in its arrangement than any
other of the series. There are indications of a number of courts
inclosed by large and small clusters of rooms, very irregularly
disposed, but with a general trend towards the northeast, being roughly
parallel with the mesa edge. In plan this village approaches somewhat
that of the inhabited Tusayan villages. At the extreme southern
extremity of the mesa promontory is a small secondary bench, 20 feet
lower than the site of the main village. This bench has also been
occupied by a number of houses. On the east side the pueblo was built to
the very edge of the bluff, where small fragments of masonry are still
standing. The whole village seems so irregular and crowded in its
arrangement that it suggests a long period of occupancy and growth, much
more than do the other villages of this (Jeditoh) group.</p>

The pueblo may have been abandoned or destroyed prior to the advent of
the Spaniards in this country, as claimed by the Indians, for no
traditional mention of it is made in connection with the later feuds and
wars that figure so prominently in the Tusayan oral history of the last
three centuries. The pueblo was undoubtedly built by some of the ancient
gentes of the Tusayan stock, as its plan, the character of the site
chosen, and, where traceable, the quality of workmanship link it with
the other villages of the Jeditoh group.</p>

MOEN-KOPI RUINS.</a></h6>

<p>A very small group of rooms, even smaller than the neighboring
farming pueblo of Moen-kopi, is situated on the western edge of the mesa
summit about a quarter of a mile north of the modern village of
Moen-kopi. As the plan shows (Fig.&nbsp;4), the
rooms were distributed in three rows around a small court. This ruin
also follows the general northeastern trend which has been noticed both
in the ruined and in the occupied pueblos of Tusayan. The rows here were
only one room deep and not more than a single story high at any point,
as indicated by the very small amount of débris. As the plate shows,
nearly the entire plan is clearly defined by fragments of standing
walls. The walls are built of thin tablets of the dark-colored sandstone
which caps the mesa. Where the walls have fallen the débris is
comparatively free

from earth, indicating that adobe has been sparingly used. The walls, in
places standing to a height of 2 or 3 feet, as may be seen in the
illustration, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">X</span>, show unusual precision of workmanship and
finish, resembling in this respect some of the ancient pueblos farther
north. This is to some extent due to the exceptional suitability of the
tabular stones of the mesa summit. The almost entire absence of pottery
fragments and other objects of art which are such a constant
accompaniment of the ruins throughout this region strongly suggest that
it was occupied for a very short time. In Chapter <span class =
"smallroman">III</span> it will be shown that a similar order of
occupation took place at Ojo Caliente, one of the Zuñi farming villages.
This ruin is probably of quite recent origin, as is the present village
of Moen-kopi, although it may possibly have belonged to an earlier
colony of which we have no distinct trace. This fertile and well watered
valley, a&nbsp;veritable garden spot in the Tusayan deserts, must have been
one of the first points occupied. Some small cliff-dwellings, single
rooms in niches of a neighboring canyon wall, attest the earlier use of
the valley for agricultural purposes, although it is doubtful whether
these rude shelters date back of the Spanish invasion of the
province.</p>

RUINS ON THE ORAIBI WASH.</a></h6>

<p>The wagon road from Keam’s Canyon to Tuba City crosses the Oraibi
wash at a point about 7 miles above the village of Oraibi. As it enters
a branch canyon on the west side of the wash it is flanked on each side
by rocky mesas and broken ledges. On the left or west side a bold
promontory, extending southward, is quite a conspicuous feature of the
landscape. The entire flat mesa summit, and much of the slope of a rocky
butte that rises from it, are covered with the remains of a small
pueblo, as shown on the plan, Fig.&nbsp;5. All of
this knoll except its eastern side is lightly covered with scattered
débris. On the west and north sides there are many large masses of
broken rock distributed over the slope. There is no standing wall
visible from below, but on closer approach several interesting specimens
of masonry are seen. On the north side, near the west end, there is a
fragment of curved wall which follows the margin of the rock on which it
is built. It is about 8 or 10 feet long and 3&nbsp;feet high on the outer
side. The curve is carefully executed and the workmanship of the masonry
good. Farther east, and still on the north side, there is a fragment of
masonry exhibiting a reversed curve. This piece of wall spans the space
between two adjoining rocks, and the top of the wall is more than 10
feet above the rock on which it stands. The shape of this wall and its
relation to the surroundings are indicated on the plan, Fig.&nbsp;5.
On the south side of the ruin on the mesa
surface, and near an outcropping rock, are the remains
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page055" id = "page055"> </a>
<!--png 131-->
of what appears to have been a circular room, perhaps 8 or 10 feet in
diameter, though it is too much broken down to determine this
accurately. Only a small portion of the south wall can be definitely
traced. On the south slope of the mesa are indications of walls, too
vaguely defined to admit of the determination of their direction.
Similar vestiges of masonry are found on the north and west, but not
extending to as great a distance from the knoll as those on the
south.</p>

<p>In that portion of the ruin which lies on top of the knoll, the walls
so far as traced conform to the shape of the site. The ground plan of
the buildings that once occupied the slopes can not be traced, and it is
impossible to determine whether its walls were carried through
continuously.</p>

<p>The masonry exhibited in the few surviving fragments of wall is of
unusually good quality, resembling somewhat that of the Fire House,
<a href = "#fig7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>, and other ruins of that class. The
stones are of medium size, not dressed, and are rather rougher and less
flat than is usual, but the wall has a good finish. The stone, however,
is of poor quality. Most of the débris about the ruin consists of small
stone fragments and sand, comparatively few stones of the size used in
the walls being seen. The material evidently came from the immediate
vicinity of the ruin.</p>

<p>Pottery fragments were quite abundant about this ruin, most of the
ware represented being of exceptional quality and belonging to the older
types; red ware with black lines and black and white ware were
especially abundant.</p>

There is quite an extensive view from the ruin, the top of the butte
commanding an outlook down the valley past Oraibi, and about 5 miles
north. There is also an extended outlook up the valley followed by the
wagon road above referred to, and over two branch valleys, one on the
east and another of much less extent on the west. The site was well
adapted for defense, which must have been one of the principal motives
for its selection.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapII_3_11" id = "chapII_3_11">
KWAITUKI.</a></h6>

<p>The ruin known to the Tusayan as Kwaituki (Fig.&nbsp;6)
is also on the west side of the Oraibi wash, 14
miles above Oraibi, and about 7 miles above the ruin last described. Its
general resemblance to the latter is very striking. The builders have
apparently been actuated by the same motives in their choice of a site,
and their manner of utilizing it corresponds very closely. The crowning
feature of the rocky knoll in this case is a picturesque group of
rectangular masses of sandstone, somewhat irregularly distributed. The
bare summit of a large block-like mass still retains the vestiges of
rooms, and probably most of the groups were at one time covered with
buildings, forming a prominent citadel-like group in the midst of the
village. To the north of this rocky butte a large area seems to have
been at one time inclosed by buildings, forming a court of unusual
dimensions. Along the outer margin of the pueblo
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>

<!--png 135-->
occasional fragments of walls define former rooms, but the amount and
character of the débris indicate that the inner area was almost
completely inclosed with buildings. The remains of masonry extend on the
south a little beyond the base of the central group of rocks, but here
the vestiges of stonework are rather faint and scattered.</p>

Ruin 14 miles north of Oraibi (Kwaituki).</p>

<p>In the nearly level tops of some of the rocks forming the central
pile are many smoothly worn depressions or cavities, which have
evidently been used for the grinding and shaping of stone
implements.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature occurring within this village is a cave or
underground fissure in the rocks, which evidently had been used by the
inhabitants. The mouth or entrance to this cavern, partly obstructed and
concealed at the time of our visit, occurs at the point A on the plan.
On clearing away the rubbish at the mouth and entering it was found so
obstructed with broken rock and fine dust that but little progress could
be made in its exploration; but the main crevice in the rock could be
seen by artificial light to extend some 10 feet back from the mouth,
where it became very shallow. It could be seen that the original cavern
had been improved by the pueblo-builders, as some of the timbers that
had been placed inside were still in position, and a low wall of masonry
on the south side remained intact. Some Navajos stated that they had
discovered this small cave a couple of years before and had taken from
it a large unbroken water jar of ancient pottery and some other
specimens. The place was probably used by the ancient occupants simply
for storage.</p>

<p>Fragments of pottery of excellent quality were very abundant about
this ruin and at the foot of the central rocks the ground was thickly
strewn with fragments, often of large size.</p>

<p>The defensive character of this site parallels that of the ruin 7
miles farther south in quite a remarkable manner, and the villages were
apparently built and occupied at the same time.</p>

<p>About 15 miles northeast of Keam’s Canyon, and about 25 miles from
Walpi, is a small ruin called by the Tusayan “Tebugkihu,” built by
people of the Fire gens (now extinct).
As the plan (Fig.&nbsp;7) clearly shows, this pueblo is very different
from the typical Tusayan villages that have been previously described.
The apparent unity of the plan, and the skillful workmanship somewhat
resembling the pueblos of the Chaco are in marked contrast to the
irregularity and careless construction of most of the Tusayan ruins. Its
distance from the center of the province, too, suggests outside
relationship; but still the Tusayan traditions undoubtedly connect the
place with some of the ancestral gentes, as seen in Chapter <span class
= "smallroman">I</span>.</p>

<p>The small and compact cluster of rooms is in a remarkable state of
preservation, especially the outside wall. This wall was carefully and
massively constructed, and stands to the height of several feet around
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page058" id = "page058"> </a>
<!--png 136-->
the entire circumference of the ruin, except along the brink of the
cliff, as the plan shows.</p>

<p>This outer wall contains by far the largest stones yet found
incorporated in pueblo masonry. A&nbsp;fragment of this masonry is
illustrated in Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XI</span>. The largest stone shown measures about 5
feet in length, and the one adjoining on the right measures about 4
feet. These dimensions are quite remarkable in pueblo masonry, which is
distinguished by the use of very small stones.</p>

Plate XI. Masonry on the outer wall of the Fire-House, detail.</p>

<p>The well defined outer wall of this cluster to the unaided eye
appears to be elliptical, but it will be seen from the plan that the
ellipse is somewhat pointed on the side farthest from the cliff. As in
other cases of ancient pueblos with curved outlines, the outer wall
seems to have been built first, and the inner rooms, while kept as
rectangular as possible, were adjusted to this curve. This arrangement
often led to a cumulating divergence from radial lines in some of the
partitions, which irregularity was taken up in one room, as in this
instance, in the space near the gate. The outer wall is uniform in
construction so far as preserved. Many irregularities appear, however,
in the construction of the inner or partition walls, and some of the
rooms show awkward attempts at adjustment to the curve of the outer
wall.</p>

<p>The ruin is situated on the very brink of a small canyon, which
probably contained a spring at the foot of the cliff close under the
ruin site, as the vegetation there has an unusual appearance of
freshness, suggesting the close proximity of water to the surface. A
steep trail evidently connected the village with the bottom of the
canyon. Some of the rocks of the mesa rim were marked by numerous
cup-like cavities similar to those seen at Kwaituki, and used in the
polishing and forming of stone implements. The type of pueblo here
illustrated belonged to a people who relied largely on the architecture
for defense, differing in this respect from the spirit of Tusayan
architecture generally, where the inaccessible character of the site was
the chief dependence.</p>

<p>The ruin called Chukubi by the Tusayan (Pl.

Mesa, about 3&nbsp;miles northeast of Mashongnavi. It occupies a promontory
above the same broad sandstone ledge that forms such a

<p>Little masonry now remains on this site, but here and there a
fragment aids in defining the general plan of the pueblo. In general
form the village was a large rectangle with a line of buildings across
its center, dividing it into two unequal courts, and a projecting wing
on the west side. As may be seen from the illustration, one end of the
ruin forms a clearly defined rectangular court, composed of buildings
mostly two rooms deep. Here, as in other ruins of Tusayan, the
arrangement about inclosed courts is in contrast with the parallelism of
rows, so noticeable a feature in the occupied villages. At the east end
of the ruin are several curious excavations. The soft sandstone has been
hollowed out to a depth of about 10 inches, in prolongation of the
outlines of adjoining rooms. Such excavation to obtain level floors is
quite unusual among the pueblo builders; it was practiced to a very
small extent, and only where it could be done with little trouble. Any
serious inequality of surface was usually incorporated in the
construction, as will be noticed at Walpi (<a href = "#plateXXIII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXIII</span></a>). Vestiges of masonry
indicating detached rooms were seen in each of the courts of the main
rectangle.</p>

<p>On the slope of the hill, just above the broad ledge previously
described, there is a fine spring, but no trace of a trail connecting it
with the pueblo could be found.</p>

<p>This village was advantageously placed for defense, but not to the
same degree as Payupki, illustrated in <a href = "#plateXIII">Pl. <span

<p>The ruin called Payupki
(Pl. <span class =

south of the trail, from Walpi to Oraibi, and about 6&nbsp;miles northwest
from Mashongnavi. The outer extremity of this promontory is separated
from the mesa by a deep notch. The summit is reached from the mesa by
way of the neck, as the outer point itself is very abrupt, much of the
sandstone ledge being vertical. A&nbsp;bench, 12 or 15 feet below the summit
and in places quite broad, encircles the promontory. This bench also
breaks off very abruptly.</p>

<p>As may be seen from the plan, the village is quite symmetrically laid
out and well arranged for defense. It is placed at the mesa end of the
promontory cap, and for greater security the second ledge has also been
fortified. All along the outer margin of this ledge are the remains of a
stone wall, in some places still standing to a height of 1 or 2 feet.
This wall appears to have extended originally all along the ledge around
three sides of the village. The steepness of the cliff on the remaining
side rendered a wall superfluous. On the plain below this promontory,
and immediately under the overhanging cliff, are two corrals, and also
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page060" id = "page060"> </a>
<!--png 140-->
the remains of a structure that resembles a kiva, but which appears to
be of recent construction.</p>

<p>In the village proper (<a href = "#plateXIV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XIV</span></a>) are two distinctly traceable kivas. One of
these, situated in the court, is detached and appears to have been
partly underground. The other, located in the southeast end of the
village, has also, like the first, apparently been sunk slightly below
the surface. There is a jog in the standing wall of this kiva which
corresponds to that usually found in the typical Tusayan kivas (see
Figs. <a href = "#fig22">22</a> and <a href = "#fig25">25</a>). On the
promontory and east of the village is a single room of more than average
length, with a well formed door in the center of one side. This room has
every appearance of being contemporary with the rest of the village, but
its occurrence in this entirely isolated position is very unusual. Still
farther east there is a mass of debris that may have belonged to a
cluster of six or eight rooms, or it may possibly be the remains of
temporary stone shelters for outlooks over crops, built at a later date
than the pueblo. As may be seen from the illustration
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XV</span>), the walls are
roughly built of large slabs of sandstone of various sizes. The work is
rather better than that of modern Tusayan, but much inferior to that
seen in the skillfully laid masonry of the ruins farther north. In many
of these walls an occasional sandstone slab of great length is
introduced. This peculiarity is probably due to the character of the
local material, which is more varied than usual. All of the stone here
used is taken from ledges in the immediate vicinity. It is usually light
in color and of loose texture, crumbling readily, and subject to rapid
decay, particularly when used in walls that are roughly constructed.</p>

occurs here, some of the fragments of black and white ware displaying
intricate fret patterns. The quantity of these potsherds is quite small,
and they occur mainly in the refuse heaps on the mesa edge.</p>

<p>This ruin combines a clearly defined defensive plan with utilization
of one of the most inaccessible sites in the vicinity, producing
altogether a combination that would seem to have been impregnable by any
of the ordinary methods of Indian warfare.</p>

<p>The village of Hano, or Tewa, is intrusive and does not properly
belong to the Tusayan stock, as appears from their own traditions. It is
somewhat loosely planned
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XVI</span>) and extends nearly across the mesa tongue,
which is here quite narrow, and in general there is no appreciable
difference between the arrangement here followed and that of the other
villages. One portion of the village, however, designated as House No. 5
on the plan, differs somewhat from the typical arrangement in long
irregular rows, and approaches the pyramidal form found among the more
eastern pueblos, notably at Taos and in portions of Zuñi. As has been
seen, tradition tells us that this site was taken up by the Tewa at a
late date and subsequent to the Spanish conquest; but some houses,
formerly belonging to the Asa people, formed a nucleus about which the
Tewa village of Hano was constructed. The pyramidal house occupied by
the old governor, is said to have been built over such remains of
earlier houses.</p>

<p>The largest building in the village appears to have been added to
from time to time as necessity for additional space arose, resulting in
much the same arrangement as that characterizing most of the Tusayan
houses, viz, a&nbsp;long, irregular row, not more than three stories
high at any point. The small range marked No.&nbsp;4 on the plan
contains a section three stories high, as does the long row and also
the pyramidal cluster above referred to. (<a href = "#plateXVII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XVII</span></a>.)</p>

<p>The kivas are two in number, one situated within the village and the
other occupying a position in the margin of the mesa. These ceremonial
chambers, so far as observed, appear to be much like those in the other
villages, both in external and internal arrangement.</p>

<p>Within the last few years the horse trail that afforded access to
Hano and Sichumovi has been converted into a wagon road, and during the
progress of this work, under the supervision of an American,
considerable blasting was done. Among other changes the marginal kiva,
which was nearly in line with the proposed improvements, was removed.
This was done despite the protest of the older men, and their
predictions of dire calamity sure to follow such sacrilege. A&nbsp;new site
was selected close by and the newly acquired knowledge of the use of
powder was utilized in blasting out the excavation for this subterranean
chamber. It is altogether probable that the sites of all former kivas
were largely determined by accident, these rooms being built at points
where natural fissures or open spaces in the broken mesa edge furnished
a suitable depression or cavity. The builders were not capable of
working the stone to any great extent, and their operations were
probably limited to trimming out such natural excavations and in part
lining them with masonry.</p>

<p>There is a very noticeable scarcity of roof-holes, aside from those
of the first terrace. As a rule the first terrace has no external
openings
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>

<!--png 144-->
on the ground and is entered from its roof through large trap-doors, as
shown on the plans. The lower rooms within this first terrace are not
inhabited, but are used as storerooms.</p>

<p>At several points ruined walls are seen, remains of abandoned rooms
that have fallen into decay. Occasionally a rough, buttress-like
projection from a wall is the only vestige of a room or a cluster of
rooms, all traces on the ground having been obliterated.</p>

<p>The mesa summit, that forms the site of this village, is nearly
level, with very little earth on its surface. A&nbsp;thin accumulation of
soil and rubbish lightly covers the inner court, but outside, along the
face of the long row, the bare rock is exposed continuously. Where the
rooms have been abandoned and the walls have fallen, the stones have all
been utilized in later constructions, leaving no vestige of the former
wall on the rocky site, as the stones of the masonry have always been
set upon the surface of the rock, with no excavation or preparation of
footings of any kind.</p>

<p>According to traditional accounts this village was founded at a more
recent date than Walpi. It has, however, undergone many changes since
its first establishment.</p>

<p>The principal building is a long irregular row, <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘similiar’">similar</ins> to that of
Hano
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XVIII</span>). A&nbsp;portion of an L-shaped cluster west of
this row, and a small row near it parallel to the main building, form a
rude approximation to the inclosed court arrangement. The terracing
here, however, is not always on the court side, whereas in ancient
examples such arrangement was an essential defensive feature, as the
court furnished the only approach to upper terraces. In all of these
villages there is a noticeable tendency to face the rows eastward
instead of toward the court. The motive of such uniformity of direction
in the houses must have been strong, to counteract the tendency to
adhere to the ancient arrangement. The two kivas of the village are
built side by side, in contact, probably on account of the presence at
this point of a favorable fissure or depression in the mesa surface.</p>

<p>On the south side of the village are the remains of two small
clusters of rooms that apparently have been abandoned a long time. A
portion of a room still bounded by standing walls has been utilized as a
corral for burros (<a href = "#plateXIX">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XIX</span></a>).</p>

<p>At this village are three small detached houses, each composed of but
a single room, a&nbsp;feature not at all in keeping with the spirit of pueblo
construction. In this instance it is probably due to the selection of
the village as the residence of whites connected with the agency or
school. Of these single-room houses, one, near the south end of the long
row, was being built by an American, who was living in another such
house near the middle of this row. The third house, although fairly well
preserved at the time of the survey, was abandoned and falling into
ruin. Adjoining the middle one of these three buildings on
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page063" id = "page063"> </a>
<!--png 146-->
the south side are the outlines of two small compartments, which were
evidently built as corrals for burros and are still used for that
purpose.</p>

<p>This village, though limited to two stories in height, has, like the
others of the first mesa, a&nbsp;number of roof holes or trapdoors in the
upper story, an approach to the Zuñi practice. This feature among the
Tusayan villages is probably due to intercourse with the more eastern
pueblos, for it seems to occur chiefly among those having such
communication most frequently. Its presence is probably the result
simply of borrowing a convenient feature from those who invented it to
meet a necessity. The conditions under which the houses were built have
hardly been such as to stimulate the Tusayan to the invention of such a
device. The uniform height of the second-story roofs seen in this
village, constituting an almost unbroken level, is a rather exceptional
feature in pueblo architecture. Only one depression occurs in the whole
length of the main row.</p>

<p>Of all the pueblos, occupied or in ruins, within the provinces of

<p>The carelessness characteristic of Tusayan architecture seems to have
reached its culmination here. The confused arrangement of the rooms,
mainly due to the irregularities of the site, contrasts with the work at
some of the other villages, and bears no comparison with much of the
ancient work. The rooms seem to have been clustered together with very
little regard to symmetry, and right angles are very unusual. (See
Fig.&nbsp;8.)</p>

<p>The general plan of the village of to-day confirms the traditional
accounts of its foundation. According to these its growth was gradual,
beginning with a few small clusters, which were added to from time to
time as the inhabitants of the lower site upon the spur of the mesa,
where the mission was established, moved up and joined the pioneers on
the summit. It is probable that some small rooms or clusters were built
on this conspicuous promontory soon after the first occupation of this
region, on account of its exceptionally favorable position as an outlook
over the fields (<a href = "#plateXXI">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXI</span></a>).</p>

<p>Though the peculiar conformation of the site on which the village has
been built has produced an unusual irregularity of arrangement, yet even
here an imperfect example of the typical inclosed court may be found, at
one point containing the principal kiva or ceremonial chamber of the
village. It is probable that the accidental occurrence of a suitable
break or depression in the mesa top determined the position of this kiva
at an early date and that the first buildings clustered about this
point.</p>

<p>A unique feature in this kiva is its connection with a second
subterranean chamber, reached from the kiva through an ordinary doorway.
The depression used for the kiva site must have been either larger than
was needed or of such form that it could not be thrown into one
rectangular
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page064" id = "page064"> </a>
<!--png 147-->
chamber. It was impossible to ascertain the form of this second room, as
the writer was not permitted to approach the connecting doorway, which
was closed with a slab of cottonwood. This chamber, used as a receptacle
for religious paraphernalia, was said to connect with an upper room
within the cluster of dwellings close by, but this could not be verified
at the time of our visit. The plan indicates that such an adjoining
chamber, if of average size, could easily extend partly under the
dwellings on either the west or south side of the court. The rocky mesa
summit is quite irregular in this vicinity, with rather an abrupt ascent
to the passageway on the south as shown in Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXII</span>. Southeast from the kiva
there is a large mass of rocks projecting above the general level, which
has been incorporated into a cluster of dwelling rooms. Its character
and relation to the architecture may be seen in <a href =
"#plateXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXIII</span></a>. So
irregular a site was not likely to be built upon until most of the
available level surface had been taken up, for even in masonry of much
higher development than can be found in Tusayan the builders, unable to
overcome such obstacles as a large mass of protruding rock, have
accommodated their buildings to such irregularities. This is very
noticeable in the center cluster of Mummy Cave (in&nbsp;Canyon del Muerto,
Arizona), where a large mass of sandstone, fallen from the roof of the
rocky niche in which the houses were built, has been incorporated into
the house cluster. Between this and another kiva to the north the mesa
top is nearly level. The latter kiva is
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page065" id = "page065"> </a>
<!--png 150-->
also subterranean and was built in an accidental break in sandstone. On
the very margin of this fissure stands a curious isolated rock that has
survived the general erosion of the mesa. It is near this rock that the
celebrated Snake-dance takes place, although the kiva from which the
dancers emerge to perform the open air ceremony is not adjacent to this
monument (<a href = "#plateXXIV">Pl. <span class =

<p>A short distance farther toward the north occur a group of three more
kivas. These are on the very brink of the mesa, and have been built in
recesses in the crowning ledge of sandstone of such size that they could
conveniently be walled up on the outside, the outer surface of rude
walls being continuous with the precipitous rock face of the mesa.</p>

<p>The positions of all these ceremonial chambers seem to correspond
with exceptionally rough and broken portions of the mesa top, showing
that their location in relation to the dwelling clusters was due largely
to accident and does not possess the significance that position does in
many ancient pueblos built on level and unencumbered sites, where the
adjustment was not controlled by the character of the surface.</p>

<p>The Walpi promontory is so abrupt and difficult of access that there
is no trail by which horses can be brought to the village without
passing through Hano and Sichumovi, traversing the whole length of the
mesa tongue, and crossing a rough break or depression in the mesa summit
close to the village. Several foot trails give access to the village,
partly over the nearly perpendicular faces of rock. All of these have
required to be artificially improved in order to render them
practicable. Plate <span class = "smallroman">XXV</span>, from a
photograph, illustrates one of these trails, which, a&nbsp;portion of the
way, leads up between a huge detached slab of sandstone and the face of
the mesa. It will be seen that the trail at this point consists to a
large extent of stone steps that have been built in. At the top of the
flight of steps where the trail to the mesa summit turns to the right
the solid sandstone has been pecked out so as to furnish a series of
footholes, or steps, with no projection or hold of any kind alongside.
There are several trails on the west side of the mesa leading down both
from Walpi and Sichúmovi to a spring below, which are quite as abrupt as
the example illustrated. All the water used in these villages, except
such as is caught during showers in the basin-like water pockets of the
mesa top, is laboriously brought up these trails in large earthenware
canteens slung over the backs of the women.</p>

<p>Supplies of every kind, provisions, harvested crops, fuel, etc., are
brought up these steep trails, and often from a distance of several
miles, yet these conservative people tenaciously cling to the
inconvenient situation selected by their fathers long after the
necessity for so doing has passed away. At present no argument of
convenience or comfort seems sufficient to induce them to abandon their
homes on the rocky heights and build near the water supply and the
fields on which they depend for subsistence.</p>

One of the trails referred to in the description of Hano has been
converted into a wagon road, as has been already described. The Indians
preferred to expend the enormous amount of labor necessary to convert
this bridle path into a wagon road in order slightly to overcome the
inconvenience of transporting every necessary to the mesa upon their own
backs or by the assistance of burros. This concession to modern ideas is
at best but a poor substitute for the convenience of homes built in the
lower valleys.</p>

<p>Mashongnavi, situated on the summit of a rocky knoll, is a compact
though irregular village, and the manner in which it conforms to the
general outline of the available ground is shown on the plan.
Convenience of access to the fields on the east and to the other

Plate XXVI. Mashongnavi, plan.</span></p>

<p>In Mashongnavi of to-day the eastern portion of the village forms a
more decided court than do the other portions. The completeness in
itself of this eastern end of the pueblo, in connection with the form of
the adjoining rows, strongly suggests that this was the first portion of
the pueblo built, although examination of the masonry and construction
furnish but imperfect data as to the relative age of different portions
of the village. One uniform gray tint, with only slight local variations
in character and finish of masonry, imparts a monotonous effect of
antiquity to the whole mass of dwellings. Here and there, at rare
intervals, is seen a wall that has been newly plastered; but,
ordinarily, masonry of 10 years’ age looks nearly as old as that built
200 years earlier. Another feature that suggests the greater antiquity
of the eastern court of the pueblo is the presence and manner of
occurrence here of the kiva. The old builders may have been influenced
to some extent in their choice of site by the presence of a favorable
depression for the construction of a kiva, though this particular
example of the ceremonial room is only partly subterranean. The other
kivas are almost or quite below the ground level. Although a favorable
depression might readily occur on the summit of the knoll, a&nbsp;deep
cavity, suitable for the construction of the subterranean kiva, would
not be likely to occur at such a distance from the margin of the
sandstone ledge. The builders evidently preferred to adopt such half-way
measures with their first kiva in order to
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page067" id = "page067"> </a>
<!--png 154-->
secure its inclosure within the court, thus conforming to the typical
pueblo arrangement. The numerous exceptions to this arrangement seen in
Tusayan are due to local causes.

<!---->
The general view of Mashongnavi given in <a href = "#plateXXVII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXVII</span></a> shows that the site of this
pueblo, as well as that of its neighbor, Shupaulovi, was not
particularly defensible, and that this fact would have weight in
securing adherence in the first portion
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page068" id = "page068"> </a>
<!--png 155-->
of the pueblo built to the defensive inclosed court containing the
ceremonial chamber. The plan strongly indicates that the other courts of
the pueblo were added as the village grew, each added row facing toward
the back of an older row, producing a series of courts, which, to the
present time, show more terracing on their western sides. The eastern
side of each court is formed, apparently, by a few additions
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page069" id = "page069"> </a>
<!--png 158-->
of low rooms to what was originally an unbroken exterior wall, and which
is still clearly traceable through these added rooms. Such an exterior
wall is illustrated in <a href = "#plateXVIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XVIII</span></a>. This process continued until the last
cluster nearly filled the available site and a wing was thrown out
corresponding to a tongue or spur of the knoll upon which it was built.
Naturally the westernmost or newer portions show more clearly
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page070" id = "page070"> </a>
<!--png 159-->
the evidence of additions and changes, but such evidence is not wholly
wanting in the older portions. The large row that bounds the original
eastern court on the west side may be seen on the plan to be of unusual
width, having the largest number of rooms that form a terrace with
western aspect; yet the nearly straight line once defining the original
back wall of the court inclosing cluster on this side has not been
obscured to any great extent by the later additions
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXVIII</span>). This
village furnishes the most striking example in the whole group of the
manner in which a pueblo was gradually enlarged as increasing population
demanded more space. Such additions were often carried out on a definite
plan, although the results in Tusayan fall far short of the symmetry
that characterizes many ruined pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

<p>A few of these ancient examples, especially some of the smaller ruins
of the Chaco group, are so symmetrical in their arrangement that they
seem to be the result of a single effort to carry out a clearly fixed
plan. By far the largest number of pueblos, however, built among the
southwest tablelands, if occupied for any length of time, must have been
subject to irregular enlargement. In some ancient examples, such
additions to the first plan undoubtedly took place without marring the
general symmetry. This was the case at Pueblo Bonito, on the Chaco,
where the symmetrical and even curve of the exterior defensive wall,
which was at least four stories high, remained unbroken, while the large
inclosed court was encroached upon by wings added to the inner terraces.
These additions comfortably provided for a very large increase of
population after the first building of the pueblo, without changing its
exterior appearance.</p>

(Fig.&nbsp;12.) The portions of a terrace, which face westward

SHUPAULOVI.</a></h6>

<p>This village, by far the smallest pueblo of the Tusayan group,
illustrates a simple and direct use of the principle of the inclosed
court. The plan
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXX</span>) shows that the outer walls are scarcely
broken by terraces, and nearly all the dwelling apartments open inwards
upon the inclosure, in this respect closely following the previously
described ancient type, although widely differing from it in the
irregular disposition of the rooms.
(Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">XXXI</span>) A comparison with the first of the
series of diagrams illustrating the growth of Mashóngnavi, will show how
similar the villages may have been at one stage, and how suitable a
nucleus for a large pueblo this village would prove did space and
character of the site permit. Most of the available summit of the rocky
knoll has already been covered, as will be seen from the topographic
sketch of the site (Fig.&nbsp;13). The plan shows
also that some efforts at extension of the pueblo have been made, but
the houses outside of the main cluster have been abandoned, and are
rapidly going to ruin. Several small rooms occur on the outer faces of
the rows, but it can be readily seen that they do not form a part of the
original plan but were added to an already complete structure.</p>

This feature is found at some of the other villages, notably at
Mashongnavi, in the central court, and at Hano, where it is located at
some distance outside of the village, near the main trail to the
mesa.</p>

<p>The plan of this small village shows three covered passageways
similar to those noted in Walpi on the first mesa, though their presence
here can not be ascribed to the same motives that impelled the Walpi to
build in this way; for the densely crowded site occupied by the latter
compelled them to resort to this expedient. One of these is illustrated
in Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXXII</span>. Its presence may be due in this instance
to a determination to adhere to the protected court while seeking to
secure convenient means of access to the inclosed area. It is remarkable
that this, the smallest of the group, should contain this feature.</p>

<p>This village has but two kivas, one of which is on the rocky summit
near the houses and the other on the lower ground near the foot of the
trail that leads to the village. The upper kiva is nearly subterranean,
the roof being but a little above the ground on the side toward the
village, but as the rocky site slopes away a portion of side wall is
exposed. This was roughly built, with no attempt to impart finish to its
outer face, either by careful laying of the masonry or by plastering.
Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXIII</span>
illustrates this kiva in connection with the southeastern portion of the
village. The plan shows how the prolongation of the side rows of the
village forms a suggestion of a second court. Its development into any
such feature as the secondary or additional courts of Mashóngnavi was
prohibited by the restricted site.</p>

Plate XXXIII. The chief kiva of Shupaulovi.</p>

<p>As in other villages of this group, the desire to adhere to the
subterranean form of ceremonial chamber outweighed the inducement to
place it within the village, or, in the case of the second kiva, even of
placing it on the same level as the houses, which are 30 feet above it
with an abrupt trail between them. It is curious and instructive to see
a room, the use of which is so intimately connected with the inner life
of the village, placed in such a comparatively remote and inaccessible
position through an intensely conservative adherence to ancient practice
requiring this chamber to be depressed.</p>

<p>The general view of the village given in <a href = "#plateXXXI">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXXI</span></a> strikingly illustrates the
blending of the rectangular forms of the architecture with the angular
and sharply defined fractures of the surrounding rock. This close
correspondence in form between the architecture and its immediate
surroundings is greatly heightened by the similarity in color. Mr.
Stephen has called attention to a similar effect on the western side of
Walpi and its adjacent mesa edge, which he thought indicates a distinct
effort at concealment on the part of the builders, by blending the
architecture with the surroundings. This similarity of effect is often
accidental, and due to the fact that the materials of the houses and of
the mesas on which they are built are identical. Even in the case of
Walpi, cited by Mr. Stephen, where the buildings come to the very mesa
edge, and in their vertical lines appear to carry out the effect of
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page073" id = "page073"> </a>
<!--png 166-->
the vertical fissures in the upper benches of sandstone, there was no
intentional concealment. It is more likely that, through the necessity
of building close to the limits of the crowded sites, a&nbsp;certain degree
of correspondence was unintentionally produced between the jogs and
angles of the houses and those of the mesa edge.</p>

<p>Such correspondence with the surroundings, which forms a striking
feature of many primitive types of construction where intention of
concealment had no part, is doubtless mainly due to the use of the most
available material, although the expression of a type of construction
that has prevailed for ages in one locality would perhaps be somewhat
influenced by constantly recurring forms in its environment. In the
system of building under consideration, such influence would, however,
be a very minute fraction in the sum of factors producing the type and
could never account for such examples of special and detailed
correspondence as the cases cited, nor could it have any weight in
developing a rectangular type of architecture.</p>

<p>In the development of primitive arts the advances are slow and
laborious, and are produced by adding small increments to current
knowledge. So vague and undefined an influence as that exerted by the
larger forms of surrounding nature are seldom recognized and
acknowledged by the artisan; on the contrary, experiments, resulting in
improvement, are largely prompted by practical requirements.
Particularly is this the case in the art of house-building.</p>

SHUMOPAVI.</a></h6>

<p>This village, although not so isolated as Oraibi, has no near
neighbors and is little visited by whites or Indians. The inhabitants
are rarely seen at the trading post to which the others resort, and they
seem to be pretty well off and independent as compared with their
neighbors of the other villages
(Pl. <span class
= "smallroman">XXXIV</span>). The houses and courts are in keeping
with the general character of the people and exhibit a degree of
neatness and thrift that contrasts sharply with the tumble-down
appearance of some of the other villages, especially those of the Middle
Mesa and Oraibi. There is a general air of newness about the place,
though it is questionable whether the architecture is more recent than
that of the other villages of Tusayan. This effect is partly due to the
custom of frequently renewing the coating of mud plaster. In most of the
villages little care is taken to repair the houses until the owner feels
that to postpone such action longer would endanger its stability. Many
of the illustrations in this chapter indicate the proportion of rough
masonry usually exposed in the walls.
At Shumopavi
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXV</span>), however,
most of the walls are smoothly plastered. In this respect they resemble
Zuñi and the eastern pueblos, where but little naked masonry can be
seen. Another feature that adds to the effect of neatness and finish in
this village is the frequent use of a whitewash of
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page074" id = "page074"> </a>
<!--png 167-->
gypsum on the outer face of the walls. This wash is used partly as an
ornament and partly as protection against the rain. The material, called
by the Mexicans “yeso,” is very commonly used in the interior of their
houses throughout this region, both by Mexicans and Indians. More rarely
it is used among the pueblos as an external wash. Here, however, its
external use forms quite a distinctive feature of the village. The same
custom in several of the cliff houses of Canyon de Chelly attests the
comparative antiquity of the practice, though not necessarily its
pre-Columbian origin.</p>

Plate XXXIV. Plan of Shumopavi.</span></p>

<p>Shumopavi, compared with the other villages, shows less evidence of
having been built on the open court idea, as the partial inclosures
assume such elongated forms in the direction of the long, straight rows
of the rooms; yet examination shows that the idea was present to a
slight extent.</p>

<p>At the southeast corner of the pueblo there is a very marked approach
to the open court, though it is quite evident that the easternmost row
has its back to the court, and that the few rooms that face the other
way are later additions. In fact, the plan of the village and the
distribution of the terraces seem to indicate that the first
construction consisted only of a single row facing nearly east, and was
not an inclosed court, and that a further addition to the pueblo assumed
nearly the same form, with its face or terraced side toward the back of
the first row only partly adapting itself by the addition of a few small
rooms later, to the court arrangement, the same operation being
continued, but in a form not so clearly defined, still farther toward
the west.</p>

<p>The second court is not defined on the west by such a distinct row as
the others, and the smaller clusters that to some extent break the long,
straight arrangement bring about an approximation to a court, though
here again the terraces only partly face it, the eastern side being
bounded by the long exterior wall of the middle row, two and three
stories high, and almost unbroken throughout its entire length of 400
feet. The broken character of the small western row, in conjunction with
the clusters near it, imparts a distinct effect to the plan of this
portion, differentiating it in character from the masses of houses
formed by the other two rows. The latter are connected at their southern
end by a short cross row which converts this portion of the village
practically into a single large house. Two covered passageways, however,
which are designated on the plan, give access to the southeast portion
of the court. This portion is partly separated from the north half of
the inclosure by encroaching groups of rooms. This partial division of
the original narrow and long court appears to be of later date.</p>

<p>The kivas are four in number, of which but one is within the village.
The latter occupies a partly inclosed position in the southwest portion,
and probably owes its place to some local facility for building a kiva
on this spot in the nature of a depression in the mesa summit; but even
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page075" id = "page075"> </a>
<!--png 170-->
with such aid the ceremonial chamber was built only partly under ground,
as may be seen in Fig. 14. The remaining three
kivas are more distinctly subterranean, and in order to obtain a
suitable site one of these was located at a distance of more than 200
feet from the village, toward the mesa edge on the east. The other two
are built very close together, apparently in contact, just beyond the
northern extremity of the village. One of these is about 3&nbsp;feet above
the surface at one corner, but nearly on a level with the ground at its
western side where it adjoins its neighbor. These two kivas are
illustrated in <a href = "#plateLXXXVIII">Pl. <span class =

<p>Here again we find that the ceremonial chamber that forms so
important a feature among these people, occupies no fixed relation to
the dwellings, and its location is largely a matter of accident, a&nbsp;site
that would admit of the partial excavation or sinking of the chamber
below the surface being the main requisite. The northwest court contains
another of the small inclosed shrines already described as occurring at
Shupaulovi and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The stonework of this village also possesses a somewhat distinctive
character. Exposed masonry, though comparatively rare in this
well-plastered pueblo, shows that stones of suitable fracture were
selected and that they were more carefully laid than in the other
villages. In places the masonry bears a close resemblance to some of the
ancient work, where the spaces between the longer tablets of stone were
carefully chinked with small bits of stone, bringing the whole wall to a
uniform face, and is much in advance of the ordinary slovenly methods of
construction followed in Tusayan.</p>

<p>Shumopavi is the successor of an older village of that name, one of
the cities of the ancient Tusayan visited by a detachment of Coronado’s
expedition in 1540. The ruins of that village still exist, and they
formerly contained vestiges of the old church and mission buildings
established
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page076" id = "page076"> </a>

by the monks. The squared beams from these buildings were considered
valuable enough to be incorporated in the construction of ceremonial
kivas in some of the Tusayan villages. This old site was not visited by
the party.</p>

ORAIBI.</a></h6>

<p>This is one of the largest modern pueblos, and contains nearly half
the population of Tusayan; yet its great size has not materially
affected the arrangement of the dwellings. The general plan (see Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXXVI</span>), simply shows an unusually
large collection of typical Tusayan house-rows, with the general
tendency to face eastward displayed in the other villages of the group.
There is a remarkable uniformity in the direction of the rows, but there
are no indications of the order in which the successive additions to the
village were made, such as were found at Mashóngnavi.</p>

<p>The rarity of covered passageways in this village is noteworthy, and
emphasizes the marked difference in the character of the Tusayan and
Zuñi ground plans. The close crowding of rooms in the latter has made a
feature of the covered way, which in the scattered plan of Oraibi is
rarely called for. When found it does not seem an outgrowth of the same
conditions that led to its adoption in Zuñi. A&nbsp;glance at the plans will
show how different has been the effect of the immediate environment in
the two cases. In Zuñi, built on a very slight knoll in the open plain,
the absence of a defensive site has produced unusual development of the
defensive features of the architecture, and the result is a remarkably
dense clustering of the dwellings. At Tusayan, on the other hand, the
largest village of the group does not differ in character from the
smallest. Occupation of a defensive site has there, in a measure taken
the place of a special defensive arrangement, or close clustering of
rooms. Oraibi is laid out quite as openly as any other of the group, and
as additions to its size have from time to time been made the builders
have, in the absence of the defensive motive for crowding the rows or
groups into large clusters, simply followed the usual arrangement. The
crowding that brought about the use of the covered way was due in Walpi
to restricted site, as nearly all the available summit of its rocky
promontory has been covered with buildings. In Zuñi, on
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page077" id = "page077"> </a>
<!--png 174-->
the other hand, it was the necessity for defense that led to the close
clustering of the dwellings and the consequent employment of the covered
way.</p>

Plate XL. Oraibi house row, showing court side.</p>

<p>A further contrast between the general plans of Oraibi and Zuñi is
afforded in the different manner in which the roof openings have been
employed in the two cases. The plan of Zuñi, <a href = "#plateLXXVI">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">LXXVI</span></a>, shows great numbers of
small openings, nearly all of which are intended exclusively for the
admission of light, a&nbsp;few only being provided with ladders. In Oraibi,
on the other hand, there are only seventeen roof openings above the
first terrace, and of these not more than half are intended for the
admission of light. The device is correspondingly rare in other villages
of the group, particularly in those west of the first mesa. In
Mashóngnavi the restricted use of the roof openings is particularly
noticeable; they all are of the same type as those used for access to
first terrace rooms. There is but one roof opening in a second story. An
examination of the plan, <a href = "#plateXXX">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXX</span></a>, will show that in Shupaúlovi but two such
openings occur above the first terrace, and in the large village of
Shumopavi, <a href = "#plateXXXIV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXXIV</span></a>, only about eight. None of the smaller
villages can be fairly compared with Zuñi in the employment of this
feature, but in Oraibi we should expect to find its use much more
general, were it not for the fact that the defensive site has taken the
place of the close clustering of rooms seen in the exposed village of
Zuñi, and, in consequence, the devices for the admission of light still
adhere to the more primitive arrangement (Pls. <span class =

<p>The highest type of pueblo construction, embodied in the large
communal fortress houses of the valleys, could have developed only as
the builders learned to rely for protection more upon their architecture
and less upon the sites occupied. So long as the sites furnished a large
proportion of the defensive efficiency of a village, the invention of
the builders was not stimulated to substitute artificial for natural
advantages. Change of location and consequent development must
frequently have taken place owing to the extreme inconvenience of
defensive sites to the sources of subsistence.</p>

<p>The builders of large valley pueblos must frequently have been forced
to resort hastily to defensive sites on finding that the valley towns
were unfitted to withstand attack. This seems to have been the case with
the Tusayan; but that the Zuñi have adhered to their valley pueblo
through great difficulties is clearly attested by the internal evidence
of the architecture itself, even were other testimony altogether
wanting.</p>

<p>The site would probably have attracted a much larger number of
settlers, had it not been so remote from the main pueblos of the
province, as in many respects it far surpasses any of the present
village sites. A&nbsp;large area of fertile soil can be conveniently
irrigated from copious springs in the side of a small branch of the
Moen-kopi wash. The village occupies a low, rounded knoll at the
junction of this branch with the main wash, which on the opposite or
southern side is quite precipitous. The gradual encroachments of the
Mormons for the last twenty years have had some effect in keeping the
Tusayan from more fully utilizing the advantages of this site
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XLII</span>).</p>

Plate XLII. The site of Moen-kopi.</p>

<p>Moen-kopi is built in two irregular rows of one-story houses. There
are also two detached single rooms in the village&mdash;one of them
built for a kiva, though apparently not in use at the time of our
survey, and the other a small room with its principal door facing an
adjoining row. The arrangement is about the same that prevails in the
other villages, the rows having distinct back walls of rude masonry.</p>

<p>Rough stone work predominates also in the fronts of the houses,
though it is occasionally brought to a fair degree of finish. Some adobe
work is incorporated in the masonry, and at one point a new and still
unroofed room was seen built of adobe bricks on a stone foundation about
a foot high. There is but little adobe masonry, however, in Tusayan. Its
use in this case is probably due to Mormon influence.</p>

<p>Moen-kopi was the headquarters of a large business enterprise of the
Mormons a number of years ago. They attempted to concentrate the product
of the Navajo wool trade at this point and to establish here a
completely appointed woolen mill. Water was brought from a series of
reservoirs built in a small valley several miles away, and was conducted
to a point on the Moen-kopi knoll, near the end of the south row of
houses, where the ditch terminated in a solidly constructed box of
masonry. From this in turn the water was delivered through a large pipe
to a turbine wheel, which furnished the motive power for the works. The
ditch and masonry are shown on the ground plan of the village (<a href =
"#plateXLIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XLIII</span></a>). This
mill was a large stone building, and no expense was spared in fitting it
up with the most complete machinery. At the time of our visit the whole
establishment had been abandoned for some years and was rapidly going to
decay. The frames had been torn from the windows, and both the floor of
the building and the ground in its vicinity were strewn with fragments
of expensive machinery, broken cog-wheels, shafts, etc. This building is
shown in Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XLV</span>, and may serve as an illustration of the
contrast between Tusayan masonry and modern stonemason’s work carried
out with the same material. The comparison, however, is not entirely
fair, as applied to the pueblo builders in general, as the Tusayan mason
is unusually careless in his work. Many old examples are seen in which
the finish of the walls compares very
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>

<!--png 177-->
favorably with the American mason’s work, though the result is attained
in a wholly different manner, viz, by close and careful chinking with
numberless small tablets of stone. This process brings the wall to a
remarkably smooth and even surface, the joints almost disappearing in
the mosaic-like effect of the wall mass. The masonry of Moen-kopi is
more than ordinarily rough, as the small village was probably built
hastily and used for temporary occupation as a farming center. In the
winter the place is usually abandoned, the few families occupying it
during the farming months returning to Oraibi for the season of
festivities and ceremonials.</p>

PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE PROVINCE.</a></h5>

<p>Though the surroundings of the Cibolan pueblos and ruins exhibit the
ordinary characteristics of plateau scenery, they have not the
monotonous and forbidding aspect that characterizes the mesas and
valleys of Tusayan. The dusty sage brush and the stunted cedar and
piñon, as in Tusayan, form a conspicuous feature of the landscape, but
the cliffs are often diversified in color, being in cases composed of
alternating bands of light gray and dark red sandstone, which impart a
considerable variety of tints to the landscape. The contrast is
heightened by the proximity of the Zuñi Mountains, an extensive
timber-bearing range that approaches within 12 miles of Zuñi, narrowing
down the extent of the surrounding arid region.</p>

<p>Cibola has also been more generously treated by nature in the matter
of water supply, as the province contains a perennial stream which has
its sources near the village of Nutria, and, flowing past the pueblo of
Zuñi, disappears a few miles below. During the rainy season the river
empties into the Colorado Chiquito. The Cibolan pueblos are built on the
foothills of mesas or in open valley sites, surrounded by broad fields,
while the Tusayan villages are perched upon mesa promontories that
overlook the valley lands used for cultivation.</p>

HAWIKUH.</a></h6>

<p>The village of Hawikuh, situated about 15 miles to the south of Zuñi,
consisted of irregular groups of densely clustered cells, occupying the
point of a spur projecting from a low rounded hill. The houses are in
such a ruined condition that few separate rooms can be traced, and these
are much obscured by débris. This débris covers the entire area
extending down the east slope of the hill to the site of the church. The
large amount of débris and the comparative thinness of such walls as are
found suggest that the dwellings had been densely clustered, and carried
to the height of several stories. Much of the space between the village
on the hill and the site of the Spanish church on the plain at its foot
is covered with masonry débris, part of which has slid down from above
(Pl. <span class =

The arrangement suggests a large principal court of irregular form. The
surrounding clusters are very irregularly disposed, the directions of
the prevailing lines of walls greatly varying in different groups. There
is a suggestion also of several smaller courts, as well as of alleyways
leading to the principal one.</p>

<p>The church, built on the plain below at a distance of about 200 feet
from the main village, seems to have been surrounded by several groups
of rooms and inclosures of various sizes, differing somewhat in
character from those within the village. These groups are scattered and
open, and the small amount of debris leads to the conclusion that this
portion of the village was not more than a single story in height.
(<a href = "#plateXLVII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XLVII</span></a>.)</p>

<p>The destruction of the village has been so complete that no vestige
of constructional details remains, with the exception of a row of posts
in a building near the church. The governor of Zuñi stated that these
posts were part of a projecting porch similar to those seen in
connection with modern houses. (See Pls. <a href = "#plateLXXI"><span
class = "smallroman">LXXI</span></a>, <a href = "#plateLXXV"><span class
= "smallroman">LXXV</span></a>.) Suggestions of this feature are met
with at other points on the plain, but they all occur within the newer
portion of the village around the church. Some of the larger inclosures
in this portion of the village were very lightly constructed, and cover
large areas. They were probably used as corrals. Inclosures for this
purpose occur at other pueblos traditionally ascribed to the same
age.</p>

<p>All the northwest portion of the village is now one large inclosure
or corral, whose walls have apparently been built of the fallen masonry
from the surrounding houses, leaving the central space clear. This wall
on the northeast side of the large inclosure apparently follows the jogs
and angles of the original houses. This may have been the outer line of
rooms, as traces of buildings occur for some distance within it. On the
opposite side the wall is nearly continuous, the jogs being of slight
projection. Here some traces of dwellings occur outside of the wall in
places to a depth of three rooms. The same thing occurs also at the
north corner. The continuation of these lines suggests a rectangular
court of considerable size, bounded symmetrically by groups of
compartments averaging three rooms deep. (<a href = "#plateL">Pl. <span

<p>Several much smaller inclosures made in the same way occur in the

At the present time dwelling rooms are traceable over a portion of the
area south and west of the church. As shown on the plan, upright posts
occasionally occur. These appear to have been incorporated into the
original walls, but the latter are so ruined that this can not be stated
positively, as such posts have sometimes been incorporated in modern
corral walls. In places they suggest the balcony-like feature seen in
modern houses, as in Hawikuh, but in the east portion of the pueblo they
are irregularly scattered about the rooms. A&nbsp;considerable area on the
west side of the ruin is covered with loosely scattered stones,
affording no suggestions of a ground plan. They do not seem sufficient
in amount to be the remains of dwelling rooms.</p>

Plate LI. Stone church at Ketchipauan.</p>

<p>The Spanish church in this pueblo was built of stone, but the walls
were much more massive than those of the dwellings. The building is well
preserved, most of the walls standing 8 or 10 feet high, and in places
14 feet. This church was apparently built by Indian labor, as the walls
everywhere show the chinking with small stones characteristic of the
native work. In this village also, the massive Spanish construction has
survived the dwelling houses.</p>

<p>The ground plan of the church shows that the openings were splayed in
the thickness of the walls, at an angle of about 45°. In the doorway, in
the east end of the building, the greater width of the opening is on the
inside, a&nbsp;rather unusual arrangement; in the window, on the north side,
this arrangement is reversed, the splay being outward. On the south side
are indications of a similar opening, but at the present time the wall
is so broken out that no well defined jamb can be traced, and it is
impossible to determine whether the splayed opening was used or not. The
stones of the masonry are laid with extreme care at the angles and in
the faces of these splays, producing a highly finished effect.</p>

<p>The position of the beam-holes on the inner face of the wall suggests
that the floor of the church had been raised somewhat above the ground,
and that there may have been a cellar-like space under it. No beams are
now found, however, and no remains of wood are seen in the “altar” end
of the church. At the present time there are low partitions dividing the
inclosed area into six rooms or cells. The Indians state that these were
built at a late date to convert the church into a defense against the
hostile Apache from the south. These partitions apparently formed no
part of the original design, yet it is difficult to see how they could
have served as a defense, unless they were intended to be roofed over
and thus converted into completely inclosed rooms. A&nbsp;stone of somewhat
larger size than usual has been built into the south wall of the church.
Upon its surface some native artist has engraved a rudely drawn
mask.</p>

<p>About 150 yards southeast from the church, and on the edge of the low
mesa upon which the ruin stands, has been constructed a reservoir of
large size which furnished the pueblo with a reserve water supply. The
ordinary supply was probably derived from the valley below, where
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page083" id = "page083"> </a>
<!--png 185-->
water is found at no great distance from the pueblo. Springs may also
have formerly existed near the village, but this reservoir, located
where the drainage of a large area discharges, must have materially
increased the water supply. The basin or depression is about 110 feet in
diameter and its present depth in the center is about 4&nbsp;feet; but it has
undoubtedly been filled in by sediment since its abandonment. More than
half of its circumference was originally walled in, but at the present
time the old masonry is indicated only by an interrupted row of large
foundation stones and fallen masonry. Some large stones, apparently
undisturbed portions of the mesa edge, have been incorporated into the
inclosing masonry. The Indians stated that originally the bottom of this
basin was lined with stones, but these statements could not be verified.
Without excavation on the upper side, the basin faded imperceptibly into
the rising ground of the surrounding drainage. Other examples of these
basin reservoirs are met with in this region.</p>

CHALOWE.</a></h6>

<p>About 15° north of west from Hawikuh, and distant 1½ miles from it,
begins the series of ruins called Chalowe. They are located on two low
elevations or foothills extending in a southwestern direction from the
group of hills, upon whose eastern extremity Hawikuh is built. The
southernmost of the series covers a roughly circular area about 40 feet
in diameter. Another cluster, measuring about 30 feet by 20, lies
immediately north of it, with an intervening depression of a foot or so.
About 475 feet northwest occurs a group of three rooms situated on a
slight rise. A&nbsp;little east of north and a half a mile distant from the
latter is a small hill, upon which is located a cluster of about the
same form and dimensions as the one first described. Several more
vaguely defined clusters are traceable near this last one, but they are
all of small dimensions.</p>

<p>This widely scattered series of dwelling clusters, according to the
traditional accounts, belonged to one tribe, which was known by the
general name of Chalowe. It is said to have been inhabited at the time
of the first arrival of the Spaniards. The general character and
arrangement however, are so different from the prevailing type in this
region that it seems hardly probable that it belonged to the same people
and the same age as the other ruins.</p>

<p>No standing walls are found in any portion of the group, and the
small amount of scattered masonry suggests that the rooms were only one
story high. Yet the débris of masonry may have been largely covered up
by drifting sand. Now it is hardly possible to trace the rooms, and over
most of the area only scattered stones mark the positions of the groups
of dwellings.</p>

earth, no vestige of the buildings showing through the dense growth of
sagebrush that now covers&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The two surviving rooms referred to appear to have been used from

Zuñi there, by the Navajo, within very recent times. These rooms have
been several times repaired, the one on the west particularly. In the
latter an additional wall has been built upon the northern side, as
shown on the plan, Fig. 15. The old roof seems to
have survived until recently, for, although at the present time the room
is covered with a roof of rudely split cedar beams, the remains of the
old, carefully built roof lie scattered about in the corners of the
room, under the dirt and débris. The openings are very small and seem to
have been modified since the original construction, but it is difficult

fallen walls, which must at one time have formed a village of
considerable size. Over most of this area the walls can not be traced;
the few rooms which can be distinctly outlined, occurring in a group on
the highest part of the hill. Standing walls are here seen, but they are
apparently recent, one room showing traces of a chimney

<p>A striking feature of this ruin is the occurrence in the northeast
corner of the village of large upright slabs of stone. The largest of
these is about 3&nbsp;feet wide and stands 5½&nbsp;feet out of the ground. One of
the slabs is of such symmetrical form that it suggests skillful
artificial treatment, but the stone was used just as it came from a seam
in the cliff above. From the same seam many slabs of nearly equal size
and symmetrical form have fallen out and now lie scattered about on the
talus below. Some are remarkable for their perfectly rectangular form,
while all are distinguished by a notable uniformity in thickness. Close
by, and apparently forming part of the same group, are a number of
stones imbedded in the ground with their upper edges exposed and placed
at right angles to the faces of the vertical monuments. The taller slabs
are said by the Indians to have been erected as a defense against the
attacks of the Apache upon this pueblo, but only a portion of the group
could, from their position, have been of any use for this

purpose. The stones probably mark graves. Although thorough excavation
of the hard soil could not be undertaken, digging to the depth of 18
inches revealed the same character of pottery fragments, ashes, etc.,
found in many of the pueblo graves. Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson found
identical remains in graves in the Rio San Francisco region which he
excavated in collecting pottery. Comparatively little is known, however,
of the burial practices of this region, so it would be difficult to

MATSAKI.</a></h6>

<p>Matsaki is situated on a foothill at the base of Tâaaiyalana, near
its northwestern extremity. This pueblo is in about the same state of
preservation as K’iakima, no complete rooms being traceable over most of
the area. Traces of walls, where seen, are not uniform in direction,
suggesting irregular grouping of the village. At two points on the plan
rooms partially bounded by standing walls are found. These appear to owe
their preservation to their occupation as outlooks over fields in the
vicinity long after the destruction of the pueblo. One of the two rooms
shows only a few feet of rather rude masonry. The walls of the other
room, in one corner, stand the height of a full story above the
surrounding débris, a&nbsp;low room under it having been partially filled up
with fallen masonry and earth. The well preserved inner corner of the
exposed room shows lumps of clay adhering here and there to the walls,
the remnants of an interior corner chimney. No trace of the supports for
a chimney hood, such as occur in the modern fireplaces, could be found.
The form outlined against the wall by these slight remains indicates a
rather rudely constructed feature which was added at a late date to the
room and formed no part of its original construction. It was probably
built while the room was used as a farming outlook. As shown on the

some little distance to the southwest of the main pueblo and was
connected with the latter by a series of rooms. The intervening space
may have been a court. At the northern edge of the village a primitive
shrine has been erected in recent times and is still in use. It is
rudely constructed by simply piling up stones to a height of 2½ or 3
feet, in a rudely rectangular arrangement, with an opening on the east.
This shrine, facing east, contains an upright slab of thin sandstone on
which a rude sun-symbol has been engraved. The governor of Zuñi, in
explaining the purpose of this shrine, compared its use to that of our
own astronomical observatories, which he had seen.</p>

rooms can not be traced. One complete room, however, has been preserved
and appears to be still occupied during the cultivation of the
neighboring “milpas.” It is roofed over and in good condition, though
the general character of the masonry resembles the older work. On the
plan (Fig.&nbsp;16) it will be seen that the
stones of the original masonry have been collected and built into a
number of large inclosures, which have in turn been partly destroyed.
The positions of the entrances to these inclosures can be traced by the
absence of stones on the surface. The general outline of the corral-like
inclosures appears to have followed comparatively well preserved
portions of the original wall, as was the case at Ketchipauan.

HALONA.</a></h6>

<p>An ancient pueblo called Halona is said to have belonged to the
Cibolan group, and to have been inhabited at the time of the conquest.
It occupied a portion of the site upon which the present pueblo of Zuñi
stands. A&nbsp;part of this pueblo was built on the opposite side of the
river, where the remains of walls were encountered at a slight depth
below the surface of the ground in excavating for the foundations of Mr.
Cushing’s house. At that time only scattered remains of masonry were met
with, and they furnished but little indication of details of plan or
arrangement. Later&mdash;during the summer of 1888&mdash;Mr. Cushing
made extensive additions to his house on the south side of the river,
and in excavating for the foundations laid bare a number of small rooms.
Excavation was continued until December of that year, when a large part
of the ancient village had been exposed. Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">LVII</span>, from a photograph,
illustrates a portion of these remains as seen from the southwest corner
of Zuñi. The view was taken in the morning during a light fall of snow
which, lightly covering the tops of the walls left standing in the
excavations, sharply defined their outlines against the shadows of the
rooms.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to restore the entire outline of the portion of
Halona that has served as a nucleus for modern Zuñi from such data as
can be procured. At several points of the present village, however,
vestiges of the old pueblo can be identified. Doubtless if access could
be obtained to all the innermost rooms of the pueblo some of them would
show traces of ancient methods of construction sufficient, at least, to
admit of a restoration of the general form of the ancient pueblo. At the
time the village was surveyed such examination was not practicable. The
portion of the old pueblo serving as a nucleus for later construction
would probably be found under houses Nos. 1 and&nbsp;4, forming practically
one mass of rooms. Strangers and outsiders are not admitted to these
innermost rooms. Outcrops in the small cluster No.&nbsp;2 indicate by their
position a continuous wall of the old pueblo, probably the external one.
Portions of the ancient outer wall are probably incorporated into the
west side of cluster No.&nbsp;1. On the north side of cluster No.&nbsp;2
(see <a href = "#plateLXXVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXVI</span></a>)
may be seen a buttress-like projection whose construction of small
tabular stones strongly contrasts with the character of the surrounding
walls, and indicates that it is a fragment of the ancient pueblo. This
projecting buttress answers no purpose whatever in its present
position.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page089" id = "page089"> </a>
<!--png 197-->
The above suggestions are confirmed by another feature in the same
house-cluster. On continuing the line of this buttress through the
governor’s house we find a projecting fragment of second story wall, the
character and finish of which is clearly shown in
Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LVIII</span>. Its
general similarity to ancient masonry and contrast with the present
careless methods of construction are very noticeable. The height of this
fragment above the ground suggests that the original pueblo was in a
very good state of preservation when it was first utilized as a nucleus
for later additions. That portion under house No.&nbsp;1 is probably equally
well preserved. The frequent renovation of rooms by the application of a
mud coating renders the task of determining the ancient portions of the
cluster by the character of the masonry a very difficult one. Ceilings
would probably longest retain the original appearance of the ancient
rooms as they are not subjected to such renovation.</p>

<p>Mr. Cushing thought that the outer western wall of the ancient pueblo
was curved in outline. It is more probable, however, that it regulated
the lines of the present outer rooms, and is reflected in them, as the
usual practice of these builders was to put one partition directly over
another in adding to the height of a building. This would suggest a
nearly rectangular form, perhaps with jogs and offsets, for the old
builders could not incorporate a curved outer wall into a mass of
rectangular cells, such as that seen in the present pueblo. On the other
hand, the outer wall of the original pueblo may have been outside of
rooms now occupied, for the village had been abandoned for some time
before the colony returned to the site.</p>

TÂAAIYALANA.</a></h6>

<p>On the abandonment of the pueblos known as the Seven Cities of
Cibola, supposed to have occurred at the time of the general uprising of
the pueblos in 1680, the inhabitants of all the Cibolan villages sought
refuge on the summit of Tâaaiyalana, an isolated mesa, 3&nbsp;miles southeast
from Zuñi, and there built a number of pueblo clusters.</p>

<p>This mesa, otherwise known as “Thunder Mountain,” rises to the height
of 1,000 feet above the plain, and is almost inaccessible. There are two
foot trails leading to the summit, each of which in places traverses
abrupt slopes of sandstone where holes have been pecked into the rock to
furnish foot and hand holds. From the northeast side the summit of the
mesa can be reached by a rough and tortuous burro trail. All the rest of
the mesa rim is too precipitous to be scaled. Its appearance as seen
from Zuñi is shown in Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LIX</span>.</p>

<p>On the southern portion of this impregnable site and grouped about a
point where nearly the whole drainage of the mesa top collects, are
found the village remains. The Zuñis stated that the houses were
distributed in six groups or clusters, each taking the place of one of
the abandoned towns. Mr. Frank H. Cushing <a class = "tag" name = "tag4"
id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> was also under the impression
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page090" id = "page090"> </a>
<!--png 198-->
that these houses had been built as six distinct clusters of one
village, and he has found that at the time of the Pueblo rebellion, but
six of the Cibolan villages were occupied. An examination of the plan,
however, will at once show that no such definite scheme of arrangement
governed the builders. There are but three, or at most four groups that
could be defined as distinct clusters, and even in the case of these the
disposition is so irregular and their boundaries so ill defined, through
the great number of outlying small groups scattered about, that they can
hardly be considered distinct. There are really thirty-eight separate
buildings
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LX</span>) ranging in size from one of two rooms, near
the southern extremity to one of one hundred and three rooms, situated
at the southwestern corner of the whole group and close to the western
edge of the mesa where the foot trails reach the summit. There is also
great diversity in the arrangement of rooms. In some cases the clusters
are quite compact, and in others the rooms are distributed in narrow
rows. In the large cluster at the northwestern extremity the houses are
arranged around a court; with this exception the clusters of rooms are
scattered about in an irregular manner, regardless of any defensive
arrangement of the buildings. The builders evidently placed the greatest
reliance on their impregnable site, and freely adopted such arrangement
as convenience dictated.</p>

The outlined area in the lower right was printed as an inset directly
below the scale of distance.</p>

<p>The masonry of these villages was roughly constructed, the walls
being often less than a foot thick. Very little adobe mortar seems to
have been used; some of the thickest and best preserved walls have
apparently been laid nearly dry
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXI</span>). The few openings still preserved also show
evidence of hasty and careless construction. Over most of the area the
debris of the fallen walls is very clearly marked, and is but little
encumbered with earth or drifted sand. This imparts an odd effect of
newness to these ruins, as though the walls had recently fallen. The
small amount of debris suggests that the majority of these buildings
never were more than one story high, though in four of the broadest
clusters (see plan, Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LX</span>) a height of two, and possibly three, stories
may have been attained. All the ruins are thickly covered by a very
luxurious growth of braided cactus, but little of which is found
elsewhere in the neighborhood. The extreme southeastern cluster,
consisting of four large rooms, differs greatly in character from the
rest of the ruins. Here the rooms or inclosures are defined only by a
few stones on the surface of the ground and partly embedded in the soil.
There is no trace of the debris of fallen walls. These outlined
inclosures appear never to have been walled to any considerable height.
Within one of the rooms is a slab of stone, about which a few ceremonial
plume sticks have been set on end within recent times.</p>

<p>The motive that led to the occupation of this mesa was defense; the
cause that led to the selection of the particular site was facility for
procuring a water supply. The trail on the west side passes a spring
half way down the mesa. There was another spring close to the foot
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page091" id = "page091"> </a>
<!--png 201-->
trail on the south side; this, however, was lower, being almost at the
foot of the talus.</p>

<p>In addition to these water sources, the builders collected and stored
the drainage of the mesa summit near the southern gap or recess. At this
point are still seen the remains of two reservoirs or dams built of
heavy masonry. Only a few stones are now in place, but these indicate
unusually massive construction. Another reservoir occurs farther along
the mesa rim to the southeast, beyond the limits of the plan as given.
As may be seen from the plan (<a href = "#plateLX">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LX</span></a>) the two reservoirs at the gap are quite
close together. These receptacles have been much filled up with
sediment. Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXII</span> gives a view of the principal or
westernmost reservoir as seen from the northeast. On the left are the
large stones once incorporated in the masonry of the dam. This masonry
appears to have originally extended around three-fourths of the
circumference of the reservoir. As at Ketchipauan, previously described,
the upper portion of the basins merged insensibly into the general
drainage and had no definite limit.</p>

<p>The Zuñi claim to have here practiced a curious method of water
storage. They say that whenever there was snow on the ground the
villagers would turn out in force and roll up huge snowballs, which were
finally collected into these basins, the gradually melting snow
furnishing a considerable quantity of water. The desert environment has
taught these people to avail themselves of every expedient that could
increase their supply of water.</p>

<p>It is proper to state that in the illustrated plan of the Tâaaiyalana
ruins the mesa margin was sketched in without the aid of instrumental
sights, and hence is not so accurately recorded as the plans and
relative positions of the houses. It was all that could be done at the
time, and will sufficiently illustrate the general relation of the
buildings to the surrounding topography.</p>

<p>All the ruins above described bear close traditional and historic
relationship to Zuñi. This is not the case with the splendidly preserved
ancient pueblo of Kin-tiel, but the absence of such close historic
connection is compensated for by its architectural interest. Differing
radically in its general plan from the ruins already examined, it still
suggests that some resemblance to the more ancient portions of Nutria
and Pescado, as will be seen by comparing the ground plans (Pls. <a href
= "#plateLXVII"><span class = "smallroman">LXVII</span></a> and <a href
= "#plateLXIX"><span class = "smallroman">LXIX</span></a>). Its state of
preservation is such that it throws light on details which have not
survived the general destruction in the other pueblos. These features
will be referred to in the discussion and comparison of these
architectural groups by constructional details in Chapter <span class =

<p>This pueblo, located nearly midway between Cibola and Tusayan, is

arm of the Pueblo Colorado wash, 22 or 23 miles north of Navajo Springs,
and about the same distance south from Pueblo Colorado (Ganado
post-office). Geographically the ruins might belong to either Tusayan or
Cibola, but Mr. Cushing has collected traditional references among the
Zuñi as to the occupation of this pueblo by related peoples at a time
not far removed from the first Spanish visit to this region.</p>

<p>The plan
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXIII</span>) shows a marked contrast to the
irregularity seen in the ruins previously described. The pueblo was
clearly defined by a continuous and unbroken outer wall, which probably
extended to the full height of the highest stories
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXIV</span>). This
symmetrical form is all the more remarkable in a pueblo of such large
dimensions, as, with the exception of Pueblo Bonito of the Chaco group,
it is the largest ancient pueblo examined by this Bureau. This village
seems to belong to the same type as the Chaco examples, representing the
highest development attained in building a large defensive pueblo
practically as a single house. All the terraces faced upon one or more
inclosed courts, through which access was gained to the rooms. The
openings in this outer wall, especially near the ground, were few in
number and very small in size, as shown in <a href = "#plateCIV">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">CIV</span></a>. The pueblo was built in two
wings of nearly equal size on the opposite slopes of a large sandy wash,
traversing its center from east to west. This wash doubtless at one time
furnished peculiar facilities for storage of water within or near the
village, and this must have been one of the inducements for the
selection of the site. At the time of our survey, however, not a drop of
water was to be found about the ruin, nor could vestiges of any
construction for gathering or storing water be traced. Such vestiges
would not be likely to remain, as they must have been washed away by the
violent summer torrents or buried under the accumulating sands. Two
seasons subsequent to our work at this point it was learned that an
American, digging in some rooms on the arroyo margin, discovered the
remains of a well or reservoir, which he cleared of sand and debris and
found to be in good condition, furnishing so steady a water supply that
the discoverer settled on the spot. This was not seen by the writer.
There is a small spring, perhaps a mile from the pueblo in a
northeasterly direction, but this source would have been wholly
insufficient for the needs of so large a village. It may have furnished
a much more abundant supply, however, when it was in constant use, for
at the time of our visit it seemed to be choked up. About a mile and a
half west quite a lagoon forms from the collected drainage of several
broad valleys, and contains water for a long time after the cessation of
the rains. About 6&nbsp;miles to the north, in a depression of a broad
valley, an extensive lake is situated, and its supply seems to be
constant throughout the year, except, perhaps, during an unusually dry
season. These various bodies of water were undoubtedly utilized in the
horticulture of the occupants of Kin-tiel; in fact, near the borders of
the larger lake referred to is a small house of two rooms; much similar
in workmanship to the main

Plate LXIV. North wall of Kin-tiel.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the inner houses differs in the two halves of the
ruin. It will be seen that in the north half the general arrangement is
roughly parallel with the outer walls, with the exception of a small
group near the east end of the arroyo. In the south half, on the other
hand, the inner rows are nearly at right angles to the outer room
clusters. An examination of the contours of the site will reveal the
cause of this difference in the different configuration of the slopes in
the two cases. In the south half the rows of rooms have been built on
two long projecting ridges, and the diverging small cluster in the north
half owes its direction to a similar cause. The line of outer wall being
once fixed as a defensive bulwark, there seems to have been but little
restriction in the adjustment of the inner buildings to conform to the
irregularities of the site. (<a href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXIII</span></a>.)</p>

<p>Only three clearly defined means of access to the interior of the
pueblo could be found in the outer walls, and of these only two were
suitable for general use. One was at a reentering angle of the outer
wall, just south of the east end of the arroyo, where the north wall,
continued across the arroyo, overlaps the outer wall of the south half,
and the other one was near the rounded northeastern corner of the
pueblo. The third opening was a doorway of ordinary size in the thick
north wall. It seems probable that other gateways once existed,
especially in the south half. From its larger size and more compact
arrangement this south half would seem to have greatly needed such
facilities, but the preserved walls show no trace of them.</p>

<p>The ground plan furnishes indications, mostly in the north half, of
several large rooms of circular form, but broken down remains of square
rooms are so much like those of round ones in appearance, owing to the
greater amount of débris that collects at the corners, that it could not
be definitely determined that the ceremonial rooms here were of the
circular form so common in the ancient pueblos. While only circular
kivas have been found associated with ancient pueblos of this type, the
kivas of all the Cibola ruins above described are said by the Zuñis to
have been rectangular. The question can be decided for this pueblo only
by excavation on a larger scale than the party was prepared to
undertake. Slight excavation at a point where a round room was indicated
on the surface, revealed portions of straight walls only.</p>

<p>The large size of the refuse heap on the south side of the village
indicates that the site had been occupied for many generations.
Notwithstanding this long period of occupation, no important structure
of the village seems to have extended beyond the plan. On the north
side, outside the main wall, are seen several rectangles faintly
outlined by stones, but these do not appear to have been rooms. They
resemble similar inclosures seen in connection with ruined pueblos
farther south, which proved on excavation to contain graves.</p>

NUTRIA.</a></h6>

<p>Nutria is the smallest of the three farming pueblos of Zuñi, and is
located about 23 miles by trail northeast from Zuñi at the head of
Nutria valley. The water supply at this point is abundant, and furnishes
a running stream largely utilized in irrigating fields in the vicinity.
Most of the village is compactly arranged, as may be seen from the plan
(Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">LXVII</span>
and Fig.&nbsp;17), but a few small clusters, of late
construction, containing two or three rooms each, are situated toward
the east at quite a distance from the principal group. It is now
occupied solely as a farming pueblo during the planting and harvesting
season.</p>

<p>The outline of this small pueblo differs greatly from those of most
of the Cibolan villages. The village (<a href = "#plateLXVIII">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">LXVIII</span></a>), particularly in its
northernmost cluster, somewhat approximates the form of the ancient
pueblo of Kin-tiel (<a href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXIII</span></a>), and has apparently been built on the
remains of an older village of somewhat corresponding form, as indicated
by its curved outer wall. Fragments of carefully constructed masonry of
the ancient type, contrasting noticeably with the surrounding modern
construction, afford additional evidence of this. The ancient village
must have been provided originally with ceremonial rooms or kivas, but
no traces of such rooms are now to be found.</p>

<p>At the close of the harvest, when the season of feasts and
ceremonials begins, lasting through most of the winter, the occupants of
these farming

villages close up their houses and move back to the main pueblo leaving
them untenanted until the succeeding spring.</p>

<p>The great number of abandoned and ruined rooms is very noticeable in
the farming pueblos illustrated in this and two of the succeeding plans
(Pls. <a href = "#plateLXIX"><span class = "smallroman">LXIX</span></a>
and <a href = "#plateLXXIII"><span class =

PESCADO.</a></h6>

<p>This village, also a Zuñi farming pueblo, is situated in a large
valley about 12 miles northeast from Zuñi. Although it is much larger
than Nutria it is wholly comprised within the compact group illustrated.
The tendency to build small detached houses noticed at Nutria and at Ojo
Caliente has not manifested itself here. The prevalence of abandoned and
roofless houses is also noticeable.</p>

<p>The outlines of the original court inclosing pueblo
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXX</span>) are very
clearly marked, as the farming Zuñis in their use of this site have
scarcely gone outside of the original limits of the ancient pueblo. The
plan, Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXIX</span> and Fig. 18, shows a
small irregular row built in the large inclosed court; this row, with
the inclosures and corrals that surround it, probably formed no part of
the original plan. The full curved outline is broken only at the west
end of the village by small additions to the outer wall, and the north
and east walls also closely follow the boundary of the original pueblo.
In fact, at two points along the north wall fragments of carefully
executed masonry, probably forming part of the external wall of the
ancient pueblo, are still preserved
(Pl. <span

once continuous to the full height of the

pueblo, but the partial restorations of the buildings by the Zuñi
farmers resemble more closely the modern arrangement. Small rooms have
been added to the outside of the cluster and in some cases the terraces
are reached by external stone steps, in contrast with the defensive
arrangement prevailing generally in pueblos of this form. A&nbsp;number of
dome-shaped ovens have been built outside the walls.</p>

OJO CALIENTE.</a></h6>

<p>The farming village of Ojo Caliente is located near the dry wash of
the Zuñi River, and is about 15 miles distant from Zuñi, in a southerly
direction. It is about midway between Hawikuh and Ketchipauan, two of
the seven cities of Cibola above described. Though situated in fertile
and well watered country and close to the remains of the ancient
villages, it bears indications of having been built in comparatively
recent times. There are no such evidences of connection with an older
village as were found at Nutria and Pescado. The irregular and small
clusters that form this village are widely scattered over a rather rough
and broken site, as shown on the plan
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXIII</span>). Here again a large portion of the village
is untenanted. The large cluster toward the eastern extremity of the
group, and the adjoining houses situated on the low, level ground,
compose the present inhabited village. The houses occupying the elevated
rocky sites to the west (<a href = "#plateLXXIV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXIV</span></a>) are in an advanced stage of decay, and
have been for a long time abandoned.</p>

<p>This southern portion of the Cibola district seems to have been much
exposed to the inroads of the Apache. One of the effects of this has
already been noticed in the defensive arrangement in the Ketchipauan
church. On account of such danger, the Zuñi were likely to have built
the first house-clusters here on the highest points of the rocky
promontory, notwithstanding the comparative inconvenience of such sites.
Later, as the farmers gained confidence or as times became safer, they
built houses down on the flat now occupied; but this apparently was not
done all at once. The distribution of the houses over sites of varying
degrees of inaccessibility, suggests a succession of approaches to the
occupation of the open and unprotected valley.</p>

<p>Some of the masonry of this village is carelessly constructed, and,
as in the other farming pueblos, there is much less adobe plastering and
smoothing of outer walls than in the home pueblo.</p>

<p>At the time of the survey the occupation of this village throughout

disintegration of the huge central pueblo. This result must be

<p>The pueblo of Zuñi is built upon a small knoll on the north bank of
the Zuñi River, about three miles west of the conspicuous mesa of
Tâaaiyalana. It is the successor of all the original “Seven Cities of
Cibola” of the Spaniards, and is the largest of the modern pueblos. As
before stated, the remains of Halona, one of the “seven cities,” as
identified by Mr. Cushing, have served as a nucleus for the construction
of the modern pueblo, and have been incorporated into the most densely
clustered portions, represented on the plan

Key to Zuñi plan (Plate LXXVI).</p>

<p>Some of the Cibolan villages were valley pueblos, built at a distance
from the rocky mesas and canyons that must have served as quarries for
the stone used in building. The Halona site was of this type, the
nearest supply of stone being 3&nbsp;miles distant. At this point (Halona)
the Zuñi River is perennial, and furnishes a plentiful supply of water
at all seasons of the year. It disappears, however, a&nbsp;few miles west in
a broad, sandy wash, to appear again 20 miles below the village,
probably through the accession of small streams from springs farther
down. The so-called river furnishes the sole water supply at Zuñi, with
the exception of a single well or reservoir on the north side of the
village.</p>

<p>Zuñi has been built at a point having no special advantages for
defense; convenience to large areas of tillable soil has apparently led
to the selection of the site. This has subjected it in part to the same
influences that had at an earlier date produced the carefully walled
fortress pueblos of the valleys, where the defensive efficiency was due
to well planned and constructed buildings. The result is that Zuñi,
while not comparable in symmetry to many of the ancient examples,
displays a remarkably compact arrangement of dwellings in the portions
of the pueblos first occupied, designated on the plan (<a href =
"#plateLXXVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXVI</span></a>) as houses
1 and&nbsp;4. Owing to this restriction of lateral expansion this portion of
the pueblo has been carried to a great height.</p>

terraces of the village from the southeast. A&nbsp;height of five distinct
terraces from the ground is attained on the south side of this cluster.
The same point, however, owing to the irregularity of the site, is only
three terraces above the ground on the north side. The summit of the
knoll upon which the older portion of Zuñi has been built is so uneven,
and the houses themselves vary so much in dimensions, that the greatest
disparity prevails in the height of terraces. A&nbsp;three-terrace portion of
a cluster may have but two terraces immediately alongside, and
throughout the more closely built portions of the village the exposed
height of terraces varies from 1&nbsp;foot to 8 or 10 feet.

been joined to the clusters wherever the demand for more space was most
urgent, without following any definite plan in their arrangement. In
such of the ancient pueblo ruins as afford evidence of having passed
through a similar experience, the crowding of additional cells seems to
have been made to conform to some extent to a predetermined plan. At
Kin-tiel we have seen how such additions to the number of habitable
rooms could readily be made within the open court without affecting the
symmetry and defensive efficiency of the pueblo; but here the nucleus of
the large clusters was small and compact, so that enlargement has taken
place only by the addition of rooms on the outside, both on the ground
and on upper terraces.</p>

<p>The highest point of Zuñi, now showing five terraces, is said to have
had a height of seven terraces as late as the middle of the present
century, but at the time of the survey of the village no traces were
seen of such additional stories. The top of the present fifth terrace,
however, is more than 50 feet long, and affords sufficient space for the
addition of a sixth and seventh story.</p>

<p>The court or plaza in which the church (Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">LXXX</span>) stands is so much larger
than such inclosures usually are when incorporated in a pueblo plan that
it seems unlikely to have formed part of the original village. It
probably resulted from locating the church prior to the construction of
the eastern rows of the village. Certain features in the houses
themselves indicate the later date of these rows.</p>

<p>The arrangement of dwellings about a court
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXII</span>),
characteristic of the ancient pueblos, is likely to have prevailed in
the small pueblo of Halona, about which clustered the many irregular
houses that constitute modern Zuñi. Occasional traces of such an
arrangement are still met with in portions of Zuñi, although nearly all
of the ancient pueblo has been covered with rooms of later date. In the
arrangement of Zuñi houses a noticeable difference in the manner of
clustering is found in different parts of the pueblo. That portion
designated as house No.&nbsp;1 on the plan, built over the remains of the
original small pueblo, is unquestionably the oldest portion of the
village. The clustering seems to have gone on around this center to an
extraordinary and exceptional extent before any houses were built in
other portions. House No.&nbsp;4 is a portion of the same structure, for
although a street or passageway intervenes it is covered with two or
three terraces, indicating that such connection was established at an
early date. The rows on the lower ground to the east
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXI</span>), where
the rooms are not so densely clustered, were built after the removal of
the defensive motive that influenced the construction of the central
pile. These portions, arranged approximately in rows, show a marked
resemblance to pueblos of known recent date. That they were built
subsequently to the main clusters is also indicated by the abundant use
of oblique openings and roof holes, where there is very little necessity
for such contrivances. This feature was originally devised to meet the
exceptional conditions of lighting
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page099" id = "page099"> </a>
<!--png 219-->
imposed by dense crowding of the living rooms. It will be referred to
again in examining the details of openings, and its wide departure from
the arrangement found to prevail generally in pueblo constructions will
there be noted. The habit of making such provisions for lighting inner
rooms became fixed and was applied generally to many clusters much
smaller in size than those of other pueblos where this feature was not
developed and where the necessity for it was not felt. These less
crowded rooms of more recent construction form the eastern portion of
the pueblo, and also include the governor’s house on the south side.</p>

ARCHITECTURE OF TUSAYAN AND CIBOLA COMPARED BY CONSTRUCTIONAL
DETAILS.</h5>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h5>

<p>In the two preceding chapters the more general features of form and
distribution in the ruined and inhabited pueblos of Tusayan and Cibola
have been described. In order to gain a full and definite idea of the
architectural acquirements of the pueblo builders it will be necessary
to examine closely the constructional details of their present houses,
endeavoring, when practicable, to compare these details with the rather
meager vestiges of similar features that have survived the destruction
of the older villages, noting the extent to which these have departed
from early types, and, where practicable, tracing the causes of such
deviation. For convenience of comparison the various details of
housebuilding for the two groups will be treated together.</p>

<p>The writer is indebted to Mr. A.&nbsp;M. Stephen, the collector of
the traditionary data already given, for information concerning the
rites connected with house building at Tusayan incorporated in the
following pages, and also for the carefully collected and valuable
nomenclature of architectural details appended hereto. Material of this
class pertaining to the Cibola group of pueblos unfortunately could not
be procured.</p>

HOUSE BUILDING.</a></h5>

<h6><a name = "chapIV_2_1" id = "chapIV_2_1">
RITES AND METHODS.</a></h6>

<p>The ceremonials connected with house building in Tusayan are quite
meager, but the various steps in the ritual, described in their proper
connection in the following paragraphs, are well defined and definitely
assigned to those who participate in the construction of the
buildings.</p>

<p>So far as could be ascertained there is no prearranged plan for an
entire house of several stories, or for the arrangement of contiguous
houses. Most of the ruins examined emphasize this absence of a clearly
defined general plan governing the location of rooms added to the
original cluster. Two notable exceptions to this want of definite plan
occur among the ruins described. In Tusayan the Fire House (<a href =
"#fig7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>) is evidently the result of a clearly defined
purpose to give a definite form to the entire cluster, just as, on a
very much larger scale, does the ruin of Kin-tiel, belonging to the
Cibola group (<a href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXIII</span></a>). In both these cases the fixing of the
outer wall on a definite line seems to have
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
<!--png 223-->
been regarded as of more importance than the specific locations of
individual rooms or dwellings within this outline. Throughout that part
of Tusayan which has been examined, however, the single room seems now
to be regarded as the pueblo unit, and is spoken of as a complete house.
It is the construction of such a house unit that is here to be
described.</p>

<p>A suitable site having been selected, the builder considers what the
dimensions of the house should be, and these he measures by paces,
placing a stone or other mark at each corner. He then goes to the woods
and cuts a sufficient number of timbers for the roof of a length
corresponding to the width of his house. Stones are also gathered and
roughly dressed, and in all these operations he is assisted by his
friends, usually of his own gens. These assistants receive no
compensation except their food, but that of itself entails considerable
expense on the builder, and causes him to build his house with as few
helpers as possible.</p>

<p>The material having been accumulated, the builder goes to the village
chief, who prepares for him four small eagle feathers. The chief ties a
short cotton string to the stem of each, sprinkles them with votive
meal, and breathes upon them his prayers for the welfare of the proposed
house and its occupants. These feathers are called Nakwa kwoci, a&nbsp;term
meaning a breathed prayer, and the prayers are addressed to Másauwu, the
Sun, and to other deities concerned in house-life. These feathers are
placed at the four corners of the house and a large stone is laid over
each of them. The builder then decides where the door is to be located,
and marks the place by setting some food on each side of it; he then
passes around the site from right to left, sprinkling piki crumbs and
other particles of food, mixed with native tobacco, along the lines to
be occupied by the walls. As he sprinkles this offering he sings to the
Sun his Kitdauwi, house song: “Si-ai, a-hai, si-ai, a-hai.” The meaning
of these words the people have now forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephen has been informed by the Indians that the man is a mason
and the woman the plasterer, the house belonging to the woman when
finished; but according to my own observation this is not the universal
practice in modern Tusayan. In the case of the house in Oraibi,
illustrated in <a href = "#plateXL">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XL</span></a> from a photograph, much, if not all, of the
masonry was laid, as well as finished and plastered, by the woman of the
house and her female relatives. There was but one man present at this
house-building, whose grudgingly performed duty consisted of lifting the
larger roof beams and lintels into place and of giving occasional
assistance in the heavier work. The ground about this house was strewn
with quantities of broken stone for masonry, which seemed to be all
prepared and brought to the spot before building began; but often the
various divisions of the work are carried on by both men and women
simultaneously. While the men were dressing the stones, the women
brought earth and water and mixed a mud plaster. Then the walls were
laid in irregular courses, using the mortar very sparingly.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">102</span>

<!--png 224-->
The house is always built in the form of a parallelogram, the walls
being from 7 to 8 feet high, and of irregular thickness, sometimes
varying from 15 to 22 inches in different parts of the same wall.</p>

<p>Pine, piñon, juniper, cottonwood, willow, and indeed all the
available trees of the region are used in house construction. The main
beams for the roof are usually of pine or cottonwood, from which the
bark has been stripped. The roof is always made nearly level, and the
ends of the beams are placed across the side walls at intervals of about
2 feet. Above these are laid smaller poles parallel with the side walls,
and not more than a foot apart. Across these again are laid reeds or
small willows, as close together as they can be placed, and above this
series is crossed a layer of grass or small twigs and weeds. Over this
framework a layer of mud is spread, which, after drying, is covered with
earth and firmly trodden down. The making of the roof is the work of the
women. When it is finished the women proceed to spread a thick coating
of mud for a floor. After this follows the application of plaster to the
walls. Formerly a custom prevailed of leaving a small space on the wall
unplastered, a&nbsp;belief then existing that a certain Katchina came and
finished it, and although the space remained bare it was considered to
be covered with an invisible plaster.</p>

<p>The house being thus far completed, the builder prepares four
feathers similar to those prepared by the chief, and ties them to a
short piece of willow, the end of which is inserted over one of the
central roof beams. These feathers are renewed every year at the feast
of Soyalyina, celebrated in December, when the sun begins to return
north ward. The builder also makes an offering to Másauwu (called
“feeding the house”) by placing fragments of food among the rafters,
beseeching him not to hasten the departure of any of the family to the
under world.</p>

<p>A hole is left in one corner of the roof, and under this the woman
builds a fireplace and chimney. The former is usually but a small cavity
about a foot square in the corner of the floor. Over this a chimney hood
is constructed, its lower rim being about 3&nbsp;feet above the floor.</p>

<p>As a rule the house has no eaves, the roof being finished with a
stone coping laid flush with the wall and standing a few inches higher
than the roof to preserve the earth covering from being blown or washed
away. Roof-drains of various materials are also commonly inserted in the
copings, as will be described later.</p>

<p>All the natives, as far as could be ascertained, regard this
single-roomed house as being complete in itself, but they also consider
it the nucleus of the larger structure. When more space is desired, as
when the daughters of the house marry and require room for themselves,
another house is built in front of and adjoining the first one, and a
second story is often added to the original house. The same ceremony is
observed in building the ground story in front, but there is no ceremony
for the second and additional stories.</p>

Anawita (war-chief of Sichumovi) describes the house in Walpi in which
he was born as having had five rooms on the ground floor, and as being
four stories high, but it was terraced both in front and rear, his
sisters and their families occupying the rear portion. The fourth story
consisted of a single room and had terraces on two opposite sides. This
old house is now very dilapidated, and the greater portion of the walls
have been carried away. There is no prescribed position for
communicating doorways, but the outer doors are usually placed in the
lee walls to avoid the prevailing southwest winds.</p>

<p>Formerly on the approach of cold weather, and to some extent the
custom still exists, people withdrew from the upper stories to the
kikoli rooms, where they huddled together to keep warm. Economy in the
consumption of fuel also prompted this expedient; but these ground-floor
rooms forming the first terrace, as a rule having no external doorways,
and entered from without by means of a roof hatchway provided with a
ladder, are ordinarily used only for purposes of storage. Even their
roofs are largely utilized for the temporary storage of many household
articles, and in the autumn, after the harvests have been gathered, the
terraces and copings are often covered with drying peaches, and the
peculiar long strips into which pumpkins and squashes have been cut to
facilitate their desiccation for winter use. Among other things the
household supply of wood is sometimes piled up at one end of this
terrace, but more commonly the natives have so many other uses for this
space that the sticks of fuel are piled up on a rude projecting skeleton
of poles, supported on one side by two upright forked sticks set into
the ground, and on the other resting upon the stone coping of the wall,
as illustrated in Fig. 19. At other times poles
are laid across a re-entering angle of a house and used as a wood rack,
without any support from the ground. At the autumn season not only is
the available space of the first terrace fully utilized, but every
projecting beam or stick is covered with strings of drying meat or
squashes, and many long poles are extended between convenient points to
do temporary

duty as additional drying racks. There was in all cases at least one
fireplace on the inside in the upper stories, but the cooking was done
on the terraces, usually at the end of the first or kikoli roof. This is
still a general custom, and the end of the first terrace is usually
walled up and roofed, and is called tupubi. Tuma is the name of the flat
baking-stone used in the houses, but the flat stone used for baking at
the kisi in the field is called tupubi.</p>

<p>Kikoli is the name of the ground story of the house, which has no
opening in the outer wall.</p>

<p>The term for the terraced roofs is ihpobi, and is applied to all of
them; but the tupatca ihpobi, or third terrace, is the place of general
resort, and is regarded as a common loitering place, no one claiming
distinct ownership. This is suggestive of an early communal dwelling,
but nothing definite can now be ascertained on this point. In this
connection it may also be noted that the eldest sister’s house is
regarded as their home by her younger brothers and her nieces and
nephews.</p>

<p>Aside from the tupubi, there are numerous small rooms especially
constructed for baking the thin, paper-like bread called piki. These are
usually not more than from 5 to 7 feet high, with interior dimensions
not larger than 7 feet by 10, and they are called tumcokobi, the place
of the flat stone, tuma being the name of the stone itself, and tcok
describing its flat position. Many of the ground-floor rooms in the
dwelling houses are also devoted to this use.</p>

<p>The terms above are those more commonly used in referring to the
houses and their leading features. A&nbsp;more exhaustive vocabulary of
architectural terms, comprising those especially applied to the various
constructional features of the kivas or ceremonial rooms, and to the
“kisis,” or temporary brush shelters for field use, will be found near
the end of this paper.</p>

<p>The only trace of a traditional village plan, or arrangement of
contiguous houses, is found in a meager mention in some of the
traditions, that rows of houses were built to inclose the kiva, and to
form an appropriate place for the public dances and processions of
masked dancers. No definite ground plan, however, is ascribed to these
traditional court-inclosing houses, although at one period in the
evolution of this defensive type of architecture they must have partaken
somewhat of the symmetrical grouping found on the Rio Chaco and
elsewhere.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapIV_2_2" id = "chapIV_2_2">
LOCALIZATION OF GENTES.</a></h6>

<p>In the older and more symmetrical examples there was doubtless some
effort to distribute the various gentes, or at least the phratries, in
definite quarters of the village, as stated traditionally. At the
present day, however, there is but little trace of such localization. In
the case of Oraibi, the largest of the Tusayan villages, Mr. Stephen has
with great care and patience ascertained the distribution of the various
gentes in the village, as recorded on the accompanying skeleton plan
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
<!--png 231-->
(<a href = "#plateXXXVII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXXVII</span></a>). An examination of the diagram in
connection with the appended list of the families occupying Oraibi will
at once show that, however clearly defined may have been the quarters of
various gentes in the traditional village, the greatest confusion
prevails at the present time. The families numerically most important,
such as the Reed, Coyote, Lizard, and Badger, are represented in all of
the larger house clusters.</p>

<p>No tradition of gentile localization was discovered in Cibola.
Notwithstanding the decided difference in the general arrangements of

INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.</a></h6>

<p>On account of the purpose for which much of the architectural data
here given were originally obtained, viz, for the construction of large
scale models of the pueblos, the material is much more abundant for the
treatment of exterior than of interior details. Still, when the walls
and roof, with all their attendant features, have been fully recorded,
little remains to be described about a pueblo house; for such of its
interior details as do not connect with the external features are of the
simplest character. At the time of the survey of these pueblos no
exhaustive study of the interior of the houses was practicable, but the
illustrations present typical dwelling rooms from both Tusayan and Zuñi.
As a rule the rooms are smaller in Tusayan than at Zuñi.</p>

<p>The illustration, Fig. 20, shows the ground
plan of a second-story room of Mashongnavi. This room measures 13 by 12½
feet, and is considerably
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
<!--png 238-->
below the average size of the rooms in these villages. A&nbsp;projecting
buttress or pier in the middle of the east wall divides that end of the
room into two portions. One side is provided with facilities for storage
in the construction of a bench or ledge, used as a shelf, 3&nbsp;feet high
from the floor; and a small inclosed triangular bin, built directly on
the floor, by fixing a thin slab of stone into the masonry. The whole
construction has been treated with the usual coating of mud, which has
afterwards been whitewashed, with the exception of a 10-inch band that
encircles the whole room at the floor line, occupying the position of a
baseboard. The other side of the dividing pier forms a recess, that is
wholly given up to a series of metates or mealing stones; an
indispensable feature of every pueblo household. It is quite common to
find a series of metates, as in the present instance, filling the entire
available width of a recess or bay, and leaving only so much of its
depth behind the stones as will afford floor space for the kneeling
women who grind the corn. In larger open apartments undivided by
buttress or pier, the metates are usually built in or near one corner.
They are always so arranged that those who operate them face the middle
of the room. The floor is simply a smoothly plastered dressing of clay
of the same character as the usual external roof covering. It is, in
fact, simply the roof of the room below smoothed and finished with
special care. Such apartments, even in upper stories, are sometimes
carefully paved over the entire surface with large flat slabs of stone.
It is often difficult to procure rectangular slabs of sufficient size
for this purpose, but the irregularities of outline of the large flat
stones are very skillfully interfitted, furnishing, when finished, a
smoothly paved floor easily swept and kept clean.</p>

<p>On the right of the doorway as one enters this house are the
fireplace and chimney, built in the corner of the room. In this case the
chimney hood is of semicircular form, as indicated on the plan. The
entire chimney is illustrated in <a href = "#fig62">Fig. 62</a>, which
represents the typical curved form of hood. In the corner of the left as
one enters are two ollas, or water jars, which are always kept filled.
On the floor near the water jars is indicated a jug or canteen, a&nbsp;form
of vessel used for bringing in water from the springs and wells at the
foot of the mesa. At Zuñi water seems to be all brought directly in the
ollas, or water jars, in which it is kept, this canteen form not being
in use for the purpose.</p>

<p>The entrance doorway to this house, as indicated on the plan, is set
back or stepped on one side, a&nbsp;type of opening which is quite common in
Tusayan. This form is illustrated in <a href =
"#fig84">Fig.&nbsp;84</a>.</p>

exceptional. Ordinarily rooms communicate with others of the
cluster.</p>

is divided midway of its length by a similar buttress. This buttress
supports a heavy girder, thus admitting of the use of two tiers of floor
beams to span the whole length of the room. The fireplace and chimney
are similar to those described, as is also the single compartment for
mealing stones. In this case, however, this portion of the room is quite
large, and the row of mealing stones is built at right angles to its
back wall and not parallel with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The right-hand portion of the room is provided with a long, straight
pole suspended from the roof beams. This is a common feature in both
Tusayan and Zuñi. The pole is used for the suspension of the household
stock of blankets and other garments. The windows of this house are
small, and two of them, in the right-hand division of the room, have
been roughly sealed up with masonry.</p>

<p>Pl. <span class =

this instance the example happens to be rather larger than the average
room. It will be noticed that this apartment has many features in common
with that at Tusayan last described. The pole upon which blankets are
suspended is here incorporated into the original construction of the
house, its two ends being deeply embedded in the masonry of the wall.
The entire floor is paved with slabs of much more regular form than any
used at Tusayan. The Zuñi have access to building stone which is of a
much better grade than is available in Tusayan.</p>

<p>This room is furnished with long, raised benches of masonry along the
sides, a&nbsp;feature much more common at Zuñi than at Tusayan. Usually such
benches extend along the whole length of a wall, but here the projection
is interrupted on one side by the fireplace and chimney, and on the left
it terminates abruptly near the beginning of a tier of mealing stones,
in order to afford floor space for the women who grind. The metates are
arranged in the usual manner, three in a row, but there is an additional
detached section placed at right angles to the main series. The sill of
the doorway by which this room communicates with an adjoining one is
raised about 18 inches above the floor, and is provided with a rudely
mortised door in a single panel. Alongside is a small hole through which
the occupant can prop the door on the inside of the communicating room.
The subsequent sealing of the small hand-hole with mud effectually
closes the house against intrusion. The unusual height of this door sill
from the floor has necessitated the construction of a small step, which
is built of masonry and covered with a single slab of stone. All the
doors of Zuñi are more or less raised above the ground or floor, though
seldom to the extent shown in the present example. This room has no
external door and can be directly entered only by means of the hatchway
and ladder shown in the drawing. At one time this room was probably
bounded by outer walls and was provided with both door and windows,
though now no evidence of the door remains, and the windows have become
niches in the wall utilized for the reception of the small odds and ends
of a Zuñi household. The

chimney of this house will be noticed as differing materially, both in
form and in its position in the room, from the Tusayan examples. This
form is, however, the most common type of chimney used in Zuñi at the
present time, although many examples of the curved type also occur. It
is built about midway of the long wall of the room. The Tusayan chimneys
seldom occupy such a position, but are nearly always built in corners.
The use of a pier or buttress-projection for the support of a roof
girder that is characteristic of Tusayan is not practiced at Zuñi to any
extent. Deer horns have been built into the wall of the room to answer
the purpose of pegs, upon which various household articles are
suspended.</p>

<p>The various features, whose positions in the pueblo dwelling house
have been briefly described above, will each be made the subject of more
exhaustive study in tracing the various modifications of form through
which they have passed. The above outline will furnish a general idea of
the place that these details occupy in the house itself.</p>

KIVAS IN TUSAYAN.</a></h5>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_1" id = "chapIV_3_1_1"><i>General use of
kivas.</i></a>&mdash;Wherever the remains of pueblo architecture occur
among the plateaus of the southwest there appears in every important
village throughout all changes of form, due to variations of environment
and other causes, the evidence of chambers of exceptional character. The
chambers are distinguishable from the typical dwelling rooms by their
size and position, and, generally, in ancient examples, by their
circular form. This feature of pueblo architecture has survived to the
present time, and is prominent in all modern pueblos that have come
under the writer’s notice, including the villages of Acoma and Jemez,
belonging to the Rio Grande group, as well as in the pueblos under
discussion. In all the pueblos that have been examined, both ancient and
modern, with the exception of those of Tusayan, these special rooms,
used for ceremonial purposes, occupy marginal or semidetached positions
in the house clusters. The latter are wholly detached from the houses,
as may be seen from the ground plans.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_2" id = "chapIV_3_1_2"><i>Origin of the
name.</i></a>&mdash;Such ceremonial rooms are known usually by the
Spanish term “estufa,” meaning literally a stove, and here used in the
sense of “sweat house,” but the term is misleading, as it more properly
describes the small sweat houses that are used ceremonially by
lodge-building Indians, such as the Navajo. At the suggestion of Major
Powell the Tusayan word for this everpresent feature of pueblo
architecture has been adopted, as being much more appropriate. The word
“kiva,” then, will be understood to designate the ceremonial chamber of
the pueblo building peoples, ancient and modern.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_3" id = "chapIV_3_1_3"><i>Antiquity of the

evident antiquity distinguish it as being especially worthy of
exhaustive study, especially as embodied in its construction maybe found
survivals of early methods of arrangement that have long ago become

<!--png 243-->
extinct in the constantly improving art of housebuilding, but which are
preserved through the well known tendency of the survival of ancient
practice in matters pertaining to the religious observances of a
primitive people. Unfortunately, in the past the Zuñi have been exposed
to the repressive policy of the Spanish authorities, and this has
probably seriously affected the purity of the kiva type. At one time,
when the ceremonial observances of the Zuñi took place in secret for
fear of incurring the wrath of the Spanish priests, the original kivas
must have been wholly abandoned, and though at the present time some of
the kivas of Zuñi occupy marginal positions in the cell clusters, just
as in many ancient examples, it is doubtful whether these rooms
faithfully represent the original type of kiva. There seems to be but
little structural evidence to distinguish the present kivas from
ordinary large Zuñi rooms beyond the special character of the fireplace
and of the entrance trap door, features which will be fully described
later. At Tusayan, on the other hand, we find a distinct and
characteristic structural plan of the kiva, as well as many special
constructive devices. Although the position of the ceremonial room is
here exceptional in its entire separation from the dwelling, this is due
to clearly traceable influences in the immediate orograpic environment,
and the wholly subterranean arrangement of most of the kivas in this
group is also due to the same local causes.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_4" id = "chapIV_3_1_4"><i>Excavation of the
kiva.</i></a>&mdash;The tendency to depress or partly excavate the
ceremonial chamber existed in Zuñi, as in all the ancient pueblo
buildings which have been examined; but the solid rock of the mesa tops
in Tusayan did not admit of the necessary excavation, and the
persistence of this requirement, which, as I shall elsewhere show, has
an important connection with the early types of pueblo building,
compelled the occupants of these rocky sites to locate their kivas at
points where depressions already existed. Such facilities were most
abundant near the margins of the mesas, where in many places large
blocks of sandstone have fallen out from the edge of the surface
stratum, leaving nearly rectangular spaces at the summit of the cliff
wall. The construction of their villages on these rocky promontories
forced the Tusayan builders to sacrifice, to a large extent, the
traditional and customary arrangement of the kivas within the
house-inclosed courts of the pueblo, in order to obtain properly
depressed sites. This accidental effect of the immediate environment
resulted in giving unusual prominence to the sinking of the ceremonial
room below the ground surface, but a certain amount of excavation is
found as a constant accompaniment of this feature throughout the pueblo
region in both ancient and modern villages. Even at Zuñi, where the
kivas appear to retain but few of the specialized features that
distinguish them at Tusayan, the floors are found to be below the
general level of the ground. But at Tusayan the development of this
single requirement has been carried to such an extent that many of the
kivas are
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
<!--png 245-->
wholly subterranean. This is particularly the case with those that
occupy marginal sites on the mesas, such as have been referred to above.
In such instances the broken-out recesses in the upper rocks have been
walled up on the outside, roughly lined with masonry within, and roofed
over in the usual manner. In many cases the depth of these rock niches
is such that the kiva roof when finished does not project above the
general level of the mesa summit, and its earth covering is
indistinguishable from the adjoining surface, except for the presence of
the box-like projection of masonry that surrounds the entrance trap door
and its ladder (see Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXXVII</span>). Frequently in such cases the surface
of the ground shows no evidence of the outlines or dimensions of the
underlying room. Examples of such subterranean kivas may be seen in the
foreground of the general view of a court in Oraibi
(Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXVIII</span>), and
in the view of the dance rock at Walpi (<a href = "#plateXXIV">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">XXIV</span></a>). But such wholly subterranean
arrangement of the ceremonial chamber is by no means universal even at
Tusayan. Even when the kiva was placed within the village courts or
close to the houses, in conformity to the traditional plan and ancient
practice as evidenced in the ruins, naturally depressed sites were still
sought; but such sites as the mesa margin affords were rarely available
at any distance from the rocky rim. The result is that most of the court
kivas are only partly depressed. This is particularly noticeable in a
court kiva in Shumopavi, an illustration of which is given in <a href =
"#fig14">Fig.&nbsp;14</a>.</p>

where a natural depression favored the builders. On the upper side the
roof is even with the ground, but on its outer or southern side the
masonry is exposed to nearly the whole depth of the chamber. At the

paraphernalia, steps are permanently built into the outside wall of the
kiva in direct contradiction to the ancient principles of construction;
that is, in having no permanent or fixed means of access from the ground
to the first roof. These are the only cases in which stone steps spring
directly from the ground, although they are a very important feature in
Tusayan house architecture above the first story, as may be seen in any
of the general views of the villages. The justification of such an
arrangement in connection with the indefensible kiva roof lies obviously
in the different conditions here found as compared with the
dwellings.</p>

<p>The subterranean kiva of the Shumopavi group, above illustrated, is
exceptional as occurring at some distance from the mesa rim. Probably
all such exceptions to the rule are located in natural fissures or
crevices of the sandstone, or where there was some unusual facility for
the excavation of the site to the required depth. The most noteworthy
example of such inner kiva being located with reference to favorable
rock fissures has been already described in discussing the ground plan
of Walpi and its southern court-inclosed kiva (<a href =
"#page065">p.&nbsp;65</a>).</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_6" id =
"chapIV_3_1_6"><i>Masonry.</i></a>&mdash;The exterior masonry of these
chambers seems in all cases to be of ruder construction than that of the
dwelling houses. This is particularly noticeable in the kivas of Walpi
on the mesa edge, but is apparent even in some of the Zuñi examples. One
of the kivas of house No.&nbsp;1 in Zuñi, near the churchyard, has small
openings in its wall that are rudely framed with stone slabs set in a
stone wall of exceptional roughness. Apparently there has never been any
attempt to smooth or reduce this wall to a finished surface with the
usual coating of adobe mud.</p>

In Tusayan also some of the kiva walls look as though they had been
built of the first material that came to hand, piled up nearly dry, and
with no attempt at the chinking of joints, that imparts some degree of
finish to the dwelling-house masonry. The inside of these kivas,
however, is usually plastered smoothly, but the interior plastering is
applied on a base of masonry even in the case of the kivas that are
wholly subterranean. It seems to be the Tusayan practice to line all
sides of the kivas with stone masonry, regardless of the completeness
and fitness of the natural cavity. It is impossible, therefore, to
ascertain from the interior of a kiva how much of the work of excavation
is artificial and how much has been done by nature. The lining of
masonry probably holds the plastering of adobe mud much better than the
naked surface of the rock, but the Tusayan builders would hardly resort
to so laborious a device to gain this small advantage. The explanation
of this apparent waste of labor lies in the fact that kivas had been
built of masonry from time immemorial, and that the changed conditions
of the present Tusayan environment have not exerted their influence for
a sufficient length of time to overcome the traditional practice. As
will be seen later, the building of a kiva is accompanied by certain
rites and ceremonies based on the use of masonry walls, additional
testimony of the comparatively recent date of the present subterranean
types.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_7" id =
"chapIV_3_1_7"><i>Orientation.</i></a>&mdash;In questioning the Tusayan
on this subject Mr. Stephen was told that no attention to the cardinal
points was observed in the plan, although the walls are spoken of
according to the direction to which they most closely approximate. An
examination of the village plans of the preceding chapters, however,
will show a remarkable degree of uniformity in the directions of kivas
which can scarcely be due to accident in rooms built on such widely
differing sites. The intention seems to have been to arrange these
ceremonial chambers approximately on the north and south line, though
none of the examples approach the meridian very closely. Most of them
face southeast, though some, particularly in Walpi, face west of south.
In Walpi four of the five kivas are planned on a southwest and northeast
line, following the general direction of the mesa edge, while the
remaining one faces southeast. The difference in this last case may have
been brought about by exigencies of the site on the mesa edge and the
form of the cavity in which the kiva was built. Again at Hano and
Sichumovi (Pls. <a href = "#plateXVI"><span class =
"smallroman">XVI</span></a> and <a href = "#plateXVIII"><span class =
"smallroman">XVIII</span></a>) on the first mesa this uniformity of
direction prevails, but, as the plans show, the kivas in these two
villages are few in number. The two kivas of Shupaulovi will be seen (<a
href = "#plateXXX">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXX</span></a>) to
have the same direction, viz, facing southeast. In Shumopavi (<a href =
"#plateXXXIV">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXIV</span></a>) there are
four kivas all facing southeast. In Mashongnavi, however (<a href =
"#plateXXVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXVI</span></a>), the same
uniformity does not prevail. Three of the kivas face south of east, and
two others built in the edge of the rocky bench on the south side of the
village face west of south. In the large village
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
<!--png 250-->
of Oraibi there is remarkable uniformity in the direction of the many
kivas, there being a variation of only a few degrees in direction in the
whole number of thirteen shown on the plan (<a href = "#plateXXXVI">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXXVI</span></a>). But in the case of the
large kiva partly above ground designated as the Coyote kiva, the
direction from which it is entered is the reverse of that of the other
kivas. No explanation is offered that will account for this curious
single exception to the rule. The intention of the builders has
evidently been to make the altar and its attendant structural features
conform to a definite direction, fixed, perhaps, by certain requirements
of the ceremonial, but the irregularity of the general village plan in
many cases resulting from its adaptation to restricted sites, has given
rise to the variations that are seen.</p>

<p>In Zuñi there was an evident purpose to preserve a certain uniformity
of direction in the kiva entrances. In house No.&nbsp;1 (Pls. <a href =
"#plateLXXVI"><span class = "smallroman">LXXVI</span></a> and <a href =
"#plateLXXVII"><span class = "smallroman">LXXVII</span></a>) there are
two kivas, distinguishable on the plan by the large divided trap door.
The entrance of these both face southeast, and it can readily be seen
that this conformity has been provided intentionally, since the rooms
themselves do not correspond in arrangement. The roof opening is in one
case across the room and in the other it is placed longitudinally. As
has been pointed out above, the general plan of arranging the kivas is
not so readily distinguished in Zuñi as in Tusayan. Uniformity, so far
as it is traceable, is all the more striking as occurring where there is
so much more variation in the directions of the walls of the houses.
Still another confirmation is furnished by the pueblo of Acoma, situated
about 60 miles eastward from Zuñi. Here the kivas are six in number and
the directions of all the examples are found to vary but a few degrees.
These also face east of south.</p>

<p>There are reasons for believing that the use of rectangular kivas is
of later origin in the pueblo system of building than the use of the
circular form of ceremonial chamber that is of such frequent occurrence
among the older ruins. Had strict orientation of the rectangular kiva
prevailed for long periods of time it would undoubtedly have exerted a
strong influence towards the orientation of the entire pueblo clusters
in which the kivas were incorporated; but in the earlier circular form,
the constructional ceremonial devices could occupy definite positions in
relation to the cardinal points at any part of the inner curve of the
wall without necessarily exerting any influence on the directions of
adjoining dwellings.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_8" id = "chapIV_3_1_8"><i>The ancient form of
kiva.</i></a>&mdash;In none of the ruins examined in the province of
Tusayan have distinct traces of ancient kivas been found, nor do any of
them afford evidence as to the character of the ceremonial rooms. It is
not likely, however, that the present custom of building these chambers
wholly under ground prevailed generally among the earlier Tusayan
villages, as some of the remains do not occupy sites that would suggest
such arrangement. The typical circular kiva characteristic
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
<!--png 253-->
of most of the ancient pueblos has not been seen within the limits of
Tusayan, although it occurs constantly in the ruins of Canyon de Chelly
which are occasionally referred to in Tusayan tradition as having been
occupied by related peoples. Mr. Stephen, however, found vestiges of
such ancient forms among the debris of fallen walls occupying two small
knolls on the edge of the first mesa, at a point that overlooks the
broken-down ruin of Sikyatki. On the southeast shoulder of one of the
knolls is a fragment of a circular wall which was originally 12 feet in
diameter. It is built of flat stones, from 2 to 4 inches thick, 6&nbsp;to 8
inches wide, and a foot or more in length, nearly all of which have been
pecked and dressed. Mud mortar has been sparingly used, and the masonry
shows considerable care and skill in execution; the curve of the wall is
fairly true, and the interstices of the masonry are neatly filled in
with smaller fragments, in the manner of some of the best work of the
Canyon de Chelly ruins.</p>

<p>The knoll farther south shows similar traces, and on the southeast
slope is the complete ground plan of a round structure 16½ feet in
diameter. At one point of the curved wall, which is about 22 inches
thick, occurs the characteristic recessed katchinkihu (described later
in discussing the interior of kivas) indicating the use of this chamber
for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<p>Although these remains probably antedate any of the Tusayan ruins
discussed above (Chapter <span class = "smallroman">II</span>), they
suggest a connection and relationship between the typical kiva of the
older ruins and the radically different form in use at the present
time.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_1_9" id = "chapIV_3_1_9"><i>Native explanations
of position.</i></a>&mdash;Notwithstanding the present practice in the
location of kivas, illustrated in the plans, the ideal village plan is
still acknowledged to have had its house-clusters so distributed as to
form inclosed and protected courts, the kivas being located within these
courts or occupying marginal positions in the house-clusters on the edge
of the inclosed areas. But the native explanations of the traditional
plan are vague and contradictory.</p>

<p>In the floor of the typical kiva is a sacred cavity called the
sipapuh, through which comes the beneficent influence of the deities or
powers invoked. According to the accounts of some of the old men the
kiva was constructed to inclose this sacred object, and houses were
built on every side to surround the kiva and form its outer wall. In
earlier times, too, so the priests relate, people were more devout, and
the houses were planned with their terraces fronting upon the court, so
that the women and children and all the people, could be close to the
masked dancers (katchinas) as they issued from the kiva. The spectators
filled the terraces, and sitting there they watched the katchinas dance
in the court, and the women sprinkled meal upon them, while they
listened to their songs. Other old men say the kiva was excavated in
imitation of the original house in the interior of the earth, where the
human family were created, and from which they climbed to the surface of
the ground
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
<!--png 254-->
by means of a ladder, and through just such an opening as the hatchway
of the kiva. Another explanation commonly offered is that they are made
underground because they are thus cooler in summer, and more easily
warmed in winter.</p>

<p>All these factors may have had some influence in the design, but we
have already seen that excavation to the extent here practiced is wholly
exceptional in pueblo building and the unusual development of this
requirement of kiva construction has been due to purely local causes. In
the habitual practice of such an ancient and traditional device, the
Indians have lost all record of the real causes of the perpetuation of
this requirement. At Zuñi, too, a&nbsp;curious explanation is offered for the
partial depression of the kiva floor below the general surrounding
level. Here it is naively explained that the floor is excavated in order
to attain a liberal height for the ceiling within the kiva, this being a
room of great importance. Apparently it does not occur to the Zuñi
architect that the result could be achieved in a more direct and much
less laborious manner by making the walls a foot or so higher at the
time of building the kiva, after the manner in which the same problem is
solved when it is encountered in their ordinary dwelling house
construction. Such explanations, of course, originated long after the
practice became established.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapIV_3_2" id = "chapIV_3_2">
METHODS OF KIVA BUILDING AND RITES.</a></h6>

<p>The external appearance of the kivas of Tusayan has been described
and illustrated; it now remains to examine the general form and method
of construction of these subterranean rooms, and to notice the attendant
rites and ceremonies.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_1" id = "chapIV_3_2_1"><i>Typical
plans.</i></a>&mdash;All the Tusayan kivas
are in the form of a <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘paralellogram’">parallelogram</ins>, usually about 25 feet
long and half as wide, the ceiling, which is from 5½ to 8 feet high,
being slightly higher in the middle than at either end. There is no
prescribed rule for kiva dimensions, and seemingly the size of the
chamber is determined according to the number who are to use it, and who
assume the labor of its construction. A&nbsp;list of typical measurements
obtained by Mr. Stephen is appended (<a href =
"#page136">p.&nbsp;136</a>).</p>

<p>An excavation of the desired dimensions having been made, or an
existing one having been discovered, the person who is to be chief of
the kiva performs the same ceremony as that prescribed for the male head
of a family when the building of a dwelling house is undertaken. He
takes a handful of meal, mixed with piki crumbs, and a little of the
crumbled herb they use as tobacco, and these he sprinkles upon the
ground, beginning on the west side, passing southward, and so around,
the sprinkled line he describes marking the position to be occupied by
the walls. As he thus marks the compass of the kiva, he sings in a
droning tone “Si-ai, a-hai, a-hai, si-ai, a-hai”&mdash;no other words
but these. The meaning of these words seems to be unknown, but all the
priests agree in saying that the archaic chant is addressed to the sun,
and it
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
<!--png 256-->
is called Kitdauwi&mdash;the House Song. The chief then selects four
good-sized stones of hard texture for corner stones, and at each corner
he lays a baho, previously prepared, sprinkles it with the mixture with
which he has described the line of the walls, and then lays the corner
stone upon it. As he does this, he expresses his hope that the walls
“will take good root hold,” and stand firm and secure.</p>

<p>The men have already quarried or collected a sufficient quantity of
stone, and a wall is built in tolerably regular courses along each side
of the excavation. The stones used are roughly dressed by fracture; they
are irregular in shape, and of a size convenient for one man to handle.
They are laid with only a very little mud mortar, and carried up, if the
ground be level, to within 18 inches of the surface. If the kiva is
built on the edge of the cliff, as at Walpi, the outside wall connects
the sides of the gap, conforming to the line of the cliff. If the
surface is sloping, the level of the roof is obtained by building up one
side of the kiva above the ground to the requisite height as illustrated
in <a href = "#fig21">Fig. 21</a>. One end of the “Goat” kiva at Walpi
is 5&nbsp;feet above ground, the other end being level with the sloping
surface. When the ledge on the precipitous face of the mesa is uneven it
is filled in with rough masonry to obtain a level for the floor, and
thus the outside wall of some of the Walpi kivas is more than 12 feet
high, although in the interior the measurement from floor to ceiling is
much less.</p>

<p>Both cottonwood and pine are used for the roof timbers; they are
roughly dressed, and some of them show that an attempt has been made to
hew them with four sides, but none are square. In the roof of the “Goat”
kiva, at Walpi, are four well hewn pine timbers, measuring exactly 6 by
10 inches, which are said to have been taken from the mission house
built near Walpi by the Spanish priests some three centuries ago. The
ceiling plan of the mungkiva of Shupaulovi (<a href =
"#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>) shows that four of these old Spanish squared
beams have been utilized in its construction. One of these is covered
with a rude decoration of gouged grooves and bored holes, forming a
curious line-and-dot ornament. The other kiva of this village contains a
single undecorated square Spanish roof beam. This beam contrasts very
noticeably with the rude round poles of the native work, one of which,
in the case of the kiva last mentioned, is a forked trunk of a small
tree. Some of the Indians say that the timbers were brought by them from
the Shumopavi spring, where the early Spanish priests had established a
mission. According to these accounts, the home mission was established
at Walpi, with another chapel at Shumopavi, and a third and important
one at Awatubi.</p>

<p>One man, Sikapiki by name, stated that the squared and carved beams
were brought from the San Francisco Mountains, more than a hundred miles
away, under the direction of the priests, and that they were carved and
finished prior to transportation. They were intended for the chapel and
cloister, but the latter building was never finished.
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
<!--png 257-->
The roof timbers were finally distributed among the people of Shumopavi
and Shupaulovi. At Shumopavi one of the kivas, known, as the
Nuvwatikyuobi (The-high-place-of-snow&mdash;San Francisco Mountains)
kiva, was built only 8&nbsp;years ago. The main roof timbers are seven in
number. Four of them are hewn with flat sides, 8&nbsp;by 12 inches to 9 by 13
inches; the other three are round, the under sides slightly hewn, and
they are 12 inches in diameter. These timbers were brought from the San
Francisco Mountains while the Spaniards were here. The Shumopavi account
states that the people were compelled to drag most of the timbers with
ropes, although oxen were also used in some cases, and that the
Spaniards used them to roof their mission buildings. After the
destruction of the mission these timbers were used in the construction
of a dwelling house, which, falling into ruin, was abandoned and pulled
down. Subsequently they were utilized as described above. In the
Teosobi, Jay, the main timbers were taken out of it many years ago and
used in another kiva. The timbers now in the roof are quite small and
are laid in pairs, but they are old and much decayed. In the Gyarzobi,
Paroquet, are six squared timbers from the Spanish mission buildings,
measuring 9 by 13 inches, 8&nbsp;by 12 inches, etc. These have the same
curious grooved and dotted ornamentation that occurs on the square beam
of Shupaulovi, above described. At the other end of the kiva are also
two unusually perfect round timbers that may have come from the mission
ruin. All of these show marks of fire, and are in places deeply
charred.</p>

<p>In continuation of the kiva building process, the tops of the walls
are brought to an approximate level. The main roof timbers are then laid
parallel with the end walls, at irregular distances, but less than
3&nbsp;feet apart, except near the middle,
where a space of about 7&nbsp;feet is
left between two beams, as there the hatchway is to be built. The ends
of the timbers rest upon the side walls, and as they are placed in
position a small feather, to which a bit of cotton string is tied
(nakwakwoci) is also placed under each. Stout poles, from which the bark
has been stripped, are laid at right angles upon the timbers, with
slight spaces between them. Near the center of the kiva two short
timbers are laid across the two main beams about 5&nbsp;feet apart; this is
done to preserve a space of 5 by 7 feet for the hatchway, which is made
with walls of stone laid in mud plaster, resting upon the two central
beams and upon the two side pieces. This wall or combing is carried up
so as to be at least 18 inches above the level of the finished roof.
Across the poles, covering the rest of the roof, willows and straight
twigs of any kind are laid close together, and over these is placed a
layer of dry grass arranged in regular rows. Mud is then carefully
spread over the grass to a depth of about 3&nbsp;inches, and after it has
nearly dried it is again gone over so as to fill up all the cracks.
A&nbsp;layer of dry earth is then spread over all and firmly trodden down, to
render the roof water-tight and bring its surface level with the
surrounding ground, following the same method and order of construction
that prevails in dwelling-house buildings.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
<!--png 260-->
Short timbers are placed across the top of the hatchway wall, one end of
which is raised higher than the other, so as to form a slope, and upon
these timbers stone slabs are closely laid for a cover. (See <a href =
"#plateLXXXVII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXVII</span></a>.) An
open space, usually about 2 by 4½ feet, is preserved, and this is the
only outlet in the structure, serving at once as doorway, window, and
chimney.</p>

<p>The roof being finished, a&nbsp;floor of stone flags is laid; but this is
never in a continuous level, for at one end it is raised as a platform
some 10 or 12 inches high, extending for about a third of the length of
the kiva and terminating in an abrupt step just before coming under the
hatchway, as illustrated in the ground plan of the mungkiva of
Shupaulovi (Fig. 22, and also in Figs. <a href =
"#fig25">25</a> and <a href = "#fig27">27</a>). On the edge of the
platform rests the foot of a long ladder, which leans against the higher
side of the hatchway, and its tapering ends project 10 or 12 feet in the
air. Upon this platform the women and other visitors sit when admitted
to witness any of the ceremonies observed in the kiva. The main floor in
a few of the kivas is composed of roughly hewn planks, but this is a
comparatively recent innovation, and is not generally deemed desirable,
as the movement of the dancers on the wooden floor shakes the fetiches
out of position.</p>

<p class = "caption"><span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 22.</span>
Ground plan of the chief kiva of Shupaulovi.</p>

<p>On the lower or main floor a shallow pit of varying dimensions, but
usually about a foot square, is made for a fireplace, and is located
immediately under the opening in the hatchway. The intention in raising
the hatchway above the level of the roof and in elevating the ceiling in
the middle is to prevent the fire from igniting them. The ordinary fuel
used in the kiva is greasewood, and there are always several bundles of
the shrub in its green state suspended on pegs driven in the wall of the
hatchway directly over the fire. This shrub, when green, smolders and
emits a dense, pungent smoke, but when perfectly dry, burns with a
bright, sparkling flame.</p>

<p>Across the end of the kiva on the main floor a ledge of masonry is
built, usually about 2&nbsp;feet high and 1&nbsp;foot wide, which serves as a
shelf for the display of fetiches and other paraphernalia during stated
observances (see <a href = "#fig22">Fig. 22</a>). A&nbsp;small, niche-like
aperture is made in the middle of this ledge, and is called the katchin
kihu (katchina house). During a festival certain masks are placed in it
when not in use by the dancers. Some of the kivas have low ledges built
along one or both sides for use as seats, and some have none, but all
except two or three have the ledge at the end containing the katchina
house.</p>

<p>In the main floor of the kiva there is a cavity about a foot deep and
8 or 10 inches across, which is usually covered with a short, thick slab
of cottonwood, whose upper surface is level with the floor. Through the
middle of this short plank and immediately over the cavity a hole of 2
or 2½ inches in diameter is bored. This hole is tapered, and is
accurately fitted with a movable wooden plug, the top of which is flush
with the surface of the plank. The plank and cavity usually occupy a
position
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
<!--png 261-->
in the main floor near the end of the kiva. This feature is the sipapuh,
the place of the gods, and the most sacred portion of the ceremonial
chamber. Around this spot the fetiches are set during a festival; it
typifies also the first world of the Tusayan genesis and the opening
through which the people first emerged. It is frequently so spoken of at
the present time.</p>

<p>Other little apertures or niches are constructed in the side walls;
they usually open over the main floor of the kiva near the edge of the
dais that forms the second level, that upon which the foot of the ladder
rests. These are now dedicated to any special purpose, but are used as
receptacles for small tools and other ordinary articles. In early days,
however, these niches were used exclusively as receptacles for the
sacred pipes and tobacco and other smaller paraphernalia.</p>

<p>In order to make clearer the relative positions of the various
features of kiva construction that have been described several typical
examples are here illustrated. The three ground plans given are drawn to
scale and represent kivas of average dimensions. Mr. Stephen has made a
series of typical kiva measurements, which is appended to this section,
and comparison of these with the plans will show the relation of the
examples selected to the usual dimensions of these rooms. <a href =
"#fig22">Fig. 22</a> is the ground plan of the mungkiva, or chief kiva,
of Shupaulovi. It will be observed that the second level of the kiva
floor, forming the <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘dias’">dais</ins> before referred to,
is about 15 inches narrower on
each side than the main floor. The narrowing of this portion of the kiva
floor is not universal and does not seem to be regulated by any rule.
Sometimes the narrowing is carried out on one side only, as in the
mungkiva of Mashongnavi (<a href = "#fig27">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>), sometimes
on both, as in the present example,
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
<!--png 264-->
and in other cases it is absent. In the second kiva of Shupaulovi,
illustrated in <a href = "#fig25">Fig. 25</a>, there is only one small
jog that has been built midway along the wall of the upper level and it
bears no relation to the point at which the change of floor level
occurs. The ledge, or <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘dias’">dais</ins>,
is free for the use of spectators, the Indians say,
just as the women stand on the house terraces to witness a dance, and do
not step into the court. The ledge in this case is about a foot above
the main floor. Benches of masonry are built along each side, though, as
the plan shows, they are not of the same length. The bench on the
eastern side is about 4&nbsp;feet shorter than the other, which is cut off by
a continuation of the high bench that contains the katchinkihu beyond
the corner of the room. These side benches are for the use of
participants in the ceremonies. When young men are initiated into the
various societies during the feasts in the fall of the year they occupy
the floor of the sacred division of the kiva, while the old members of
the order occupy the benches along the wall. The higher bench at the end
of the room is used as a shelf for paraphernalia. The hole, or recess,
in this bench, whose position is indicated by the dotted lines on the
plan, is the sacred orifice from which the katchina is said to come, and
is called the katchinkihu. In the floor of the kiva, near the
katchinkihu, is the sipapuh, the cottonwood plug set into a cottonwood
slab over a cavity in the floor. The plan shows how this plank, about 18
inches wide and 6½ feet long, has been incorporated into the paving of
the main floor. The paving is composed of some quite large slabs of
sandstone whose irregular edges have been skillfully fitted to form a
smooth and well finished pavement. The position of the niches that form
pipe receptacles is shown on the plan opposite the fireplace in each
side wall. The position of the foot of the ladder is indicated, the side
poles resting upon the paved surface of the second level about 15 inches
from the edge of the step. <a href = "#fig23">Fig.&nbsp;23</a> gives a
ceiling plan of the same kiva, illustrating the arrangement

of such of the roof beams and sticks as are visible from inside. The
plan shows the position of the four Spanish beams before referred to,
the northernmost being the one that has the line and dot decoration. The
next two beams, laid in contact, are also square and of Spanish make.
The fourth Spanish beam is on the northern edge of the hatchway dome and
supports its wall. The adjoining beam is round and of native
workmanship. The position and dimensions of the large hatchway
projection are here indicated in plan, but the general appearance of
this curious feature of the Tusayan kiva can be better seen from the
interior view (Fig.&nbsp;24). Various uses are
attributed to this domelike structure, aside from the explanation that
it is built at a greater height in order to lessen the danger of
ignition of the roof beams. The old men say that formerly they smoked
and preserved meat in it. Others say it was used for drying bundles of
wood by suspension over the fire preparatory to use in the fireplace. It
is also said to constitute an upper chamber to facilitate the egress of
smoke, and doubtless it aids in the performance of this good office.</p>

stonework is much blackened as though the kiva had long been used with
the wall in this uncovered condition.</p>

<p>The fireplace is simply a shallow pit about 18 inches square that is
placed directly under the opening of the combined hatchway and smoke
hole. It is usually situated from 2 to 3 feet from the edge of the
second level of the kiva floor. The paving stones are usually finished
quite neatly and smoothly where their edges enframe the firepit.</p>

illustrate the ground and ceiling plans of the second kiva of the same
village. In all essential principles of arrangement it is identical with
the preceding example, but minor modifications will be noticed in
several of the features. The bench at the katchina, or “altar” end of
the kiva, has not the height that was seen in the mungkiva, but is on
the same level as the benches of the sides. Here the
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
<!--png 269-->
sipapuh is at much greater distance than usual from the katchina recess.
It is also quite exceptional in that the plug is let into an orifice in
one of the paving stones, as shown on the plan, instead of into a
cottonwood plank. Some of the paving stones forming the floor of this
kiva are quite regular in shape and of unusual dimensions, one of them
being nearly 5&nbsp;feet long and 2&nbsp;feet wide. The gray polish of long
continued use imparts to these stones an appearance of great hardness.
The ceiling plan of this kiva (Fig.&nbsp;26)
shows a single specimen of Spanish beam at the extreme north end of the
roof. It also shows a forked “viga” or ceiling beam, which is quite
unusual.</p>

<p>This kiva is better plastered than the mungkiva and shows in places
evidences of many successive coats. The general rule of applying the
interior plastering of the kiva on a base of masonry has been violated
in this example. The north end and part of the adjoining sides have been
brought to an even face by filling in the inequalities of the excavation
with reeds which are applied in a vertical position and are held in
place by long, slender, horizontal rods, forming a rude matting or
wattling. The rods are fastened to the rocky wall at favorable points by
means of small prongs of some hard wood, and the whole of the primitive
lathing is then thickly plastered with adobe mud. Mr. Stephen found the
Ponobi kiva of Oraibi treated in the same manner. The walls are lined
with a reed lathing over which mud is plastered. The reed used is the
Bakabi (<i>Phragmites communis</i>) whose stalks vary from a quarter of
an inch to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. In this instance the
reeds are also laid vertically, but they are applied to the ordinary
mud-laid kiva wall and not directly to the sides of the natural
excavation. The vertical laths are bound in place by horizontal reeds
laid upon them 1&nbsp;or 2 feet apart. The horizontal reeds
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
<!--png 272-->
are held in place by pegs of greasewood driven into the wall at
intervals of 1&nbsp;or 2 feet and are tied to the pegs with split yucca.
These specimens are very interesting examples of aboriginal lathing and
plastering applied to stone work.</p>

Ground plan of the chief kiva of Mashongnavi.</p>

<p>The ground plan of the mungkiva of Mashongnavi is illustrated in
Fig. 27. In this example the narrowing of the room
at the second level of the floor is on one side. The step by which the
upper level is reached from the main floor is 8&nbsp;inches high at the east
end, rising to 10 inches at the west end. The south end of the kiva is
provided with a small opening like a loop-hole, furnishing an outlook to
the south. The east side of the main portion of the kiva is not provided
with the usual bench. The portion of the bench at the katchina end of
the kiva is on a level with the west bench and continuous for a couple
of feet beyond the northeast corner along the east wall. The small wall
niches are on the west side and nearer the north end than usual. The
arrangement of the katchinkihu is quite different from that described in
the Shupaulovi kivas. The orifice occurs in the north wall at a height
of 3½ feet above the floor, and 2&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches above the top of the
bench that extends across this end of the room. The firepit is somewhat
smaller than in the other examples illustrated. Fig.
28 illustrates the appearance of the kiva hatchway from within as
seen from the north end of the kiva, but the ladder has been omitted
from the drawing to avoid confusion. The ladder rests against the edge
of the coping that caps the dwarf wall on the near side of the hatchway,
its top leaning toward the spectator. The small smoke-blackened sticks
that are used for the suspension of bundles of greasewood and other fuel
in the hatchway are clearly shown. At the far end of the trapdoor, on
the outside, is indicated the mat of reeds or rushes that is used for
closing the openings when necessary. It is here shown rolled up at the
foot of the slope of the hatchway top, its customary position when not
in use.
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>

wall and provided with orifices for the attachment of looms. This
feature is a common accompaniment of kiva construction and pertains to
the use of the ceremonial room as a workshop by the male blanket weavers
of Tusayan. It will be more fully described in the discussion of the
various uses of the kiva.</p>

<p>The essential structural features of the kivas above described are
remarkably similar, though the illustrations of types have been selected
at random. Minor modifications are seen in the positions of many of the
features, but a certain general relation between the various
constructional requirements of the ceremonial room is found to prevail
throughout all the villages.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_2" id = "chapIV_3_2_2"><i>Work by
women.</i></a>&mdash;After all the above described details have been
provided for, following the completion of the roofs and floors, the
women belonging to the people who are to occupy the kiva continue the
labor of its construction. They go over the interior surface of the
walls, breaking off projections and filling up the interstices with
small stones, and then they smoothly plaster the walls and the inside of
the hatchway with mud, and sometimes whitewash them with a gypsiferous
clay found in the neighborhood. Once every year, at the feast of Powuma
(the fructifying moon), the women give the kiva this same attention.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_3" id =
"chapIV_3_2_3"><i>Consecration.</i></a>&mdash;When all the work is
finished the kiva chief prepares a baho and “feeds the house,” as it is
termed; that is, he thrusts a little meal, with piki crumbs, over one of
the roof timbers, and in the same place inserts the end of the baho. As
he does this he expresses his hope that the roof may never fall and that
sickness and other evils may never enter the kiva.</p>

<p>It is difficult to elicit intelligent explanation of the theory of
the baho and the prayer ceremonies in either kiva or house construction.
The baho is a prayer token; the petitioner is not satisfied by merely
speaking or singing his prayer, he must have some tangible thing upon
which to transmit it. He regards his prayer as a mysterious, impalpable
portion of his own substance, and hence he seeks to embody it in some
object, which thus becomes consecrated. The baho, which is inserted in
the roof of the kiva, is a piece of willow twig about six inches long,
stripped of its bark and painted. From it hang four small feathers
suspended by short cotton strings tied at equal distances along the
twig. In order to obtain recognition from the powers especially
addressed, different colored feathers and distinct methods of attaching
them to bits of wood and string are resorted to. In the present case
these are addressed to the “chiefs” who control the paths taken by the
people after coming up from the interior of the earth. They are thus
designated:</p>

<!--png 276-->
Two separate feathers are also attached to the roof. These are addressed
to the zenith, héyap omáuwu&mdash;the invisible space of the
above&mdash;and to the nadir, Myuingwa&mdash;god of the interior of the
earth and maker of the germ of life. To the four first mentioned the
bahos under the corner stones are also addressed. These feathers are
prepared by the kiva chief in another kiva. He smokes devoutly over
them, and as he exhales the smoke upon them he formulates the prayers to
the chiefs or powers, who not only control the paths or lives of all the
people, but also preside over the six regions of space whence come all
the necessaries of life. The ancients also occupy his thoughts during
these devotions; he desires that all the pleasures they enjoyed while
here may come to his people, and he reciprocally wishes the ancients to
partake of all the enjoyments of the living.</p>

<p>All the labor and ceremonies being completed the women prepare food
for a feast. Friends are invited, and the men dance all night in the
kiva to the accompaniment of their own songs and the beating of a
primitive drum, rejoicing over their new home. The kiva chief then
proclaims the name by which the kiva will be known. This is often merely
a term of his choosing, often without reference to its
appropriateness.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_4" id = "chapIV_3_2_4"><i>Various uses of
kivas.</i></a>&mdash;Allusions occur in some of the traditions,
suggesting that in earlier times one class of kiva was devoted wholly to
the purposes of a ceremonial chamber, and was constantly occupied by a
priest. An altar and fetiches were permanently maintained, and
appropriate groups of these fetiches were displayed from month to month,
as the different priests of the sacred feasts succeeded each other, each
new moon bringing its prescribed feast.</p>

<p>Many of the kivas were built by religious societies, which still hold
their stated observances in them, and in Oraibi several still bear the
names of the societies using them. A&nbsp;society always celebrates in a
particular kiva, but none of these kivas are now preserved exclusively
for religious purposes; they are all places of social resort for the
men, especially during the winter, when they occupy themselves with the
arts common among them. The same kiva thus serves as a temple during a
sacred feast, at other times as a council house for the discussion of
public affairs. It is also used as a workshop by the industrious and as
a lounging place by the idle.</p>

<p>There are still traces of two classes of kiva, marked by the
distinction that only certain ones contain the sipapuh, and in these the
more important ceremonies are held. It is said that no sipapuh has been
made recently. The prescribed operation is performed by the chief and
the assistant priests or fetich keepers of the society owning the kiva.
Some say the mystic lore pertaining to its preparation is lost and none
can now be made. It is also said that a stone sipapuh was formerly used
instead of the cottonwood plank now commonly seen. The use of stone for
this purpose, however, is nearly obsolete, though the second
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
<!--png 279-->
kiva of Shupaulovi, illustrated in plan in <a href = "#fig25">Fig.
25</a>, contains an example of this ancient form. In one of the newest
kivas of Mashongnavi the plank of the sipapuh is pierced with a square
hole, which is cut with a shoulder, the shoulder supporting the plug
with which the orifice is closed (see Fig.&nbsp;30).
This is a decided innovation on the traditional form, as the orifice
from which the people emerged, which is symbolized in the sipapuh, is
described as being of circular form in all the versions of the Tusayan
genesis myth. The presence of the sipapuh possibly at one time
distinguished such kivas as were considered strictly consecrated to
religious observances from those that were of more general use. At
Tusayan, at the present time, certain societies do not meet in the
ordinary kiva but in an apartment of a dwelling house, each society
having its own exclusive place of meeting. The house so used is called
the house of the “Sister of the eldest brother,” meaning, probably, that
she is the descendant of the founder of the society. This woman’s house
is also called the “house of grandmother,” and in it is preserved the
tiponi and other fetiches of the society. The tiponi is a ceremonial
object about 18 inches long, consisting of feathers set upright around a
small disk of silicified wood, which serves as its base when set upon
the altar. This fetich is also called iso (grandmother), hence the name
given to the house where it is kept. In the house, where the order of
warriors (Kuleataka) meets, the eldest son of the woman who owns it is
the chief of the order. The apartment in which they meet is a low room
on the ground floor, and is entered only by a hatchway and ladder. There
is no sipapuh in this chamber, for the warriors appeal directly to
Cótukinungwa, the heart of the zenith, the sky god. Large figures of
animal fetiches are painted in different colors upon the walls. On the
west wall is the Mountain Lion; on the south, the Bear; on the east, the
Wild Cat, surmounted with a shield inclosing a star; on the north, the
White Wolf; and on the east side of this figure is painted a large disk,
representing the sun. The walls of the chambers of the other societies
are not decorated permanently. Here is, then, really another class of
kiva, although it is not so called by the people on the Walpi mesa. The
ordinary term for the ground story rooms is used, “kikoli,” the house
without any opening in its walls. But on the second mesa, and at Oraibi,
although they sometimes use this term kikoli, they commonly apply the
term “kiva” to the ground story of the dwelling house used as well as to
the underground chambers.</p>

<p>It is probable that a class of kivas, not specially consecrated, has
existed from a very early period. The rooms in the dwelling houses have
always been small and dark, and in early times without chimneys.
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
<!--png 280-->
Within such cramped limits it was inconvenient for the men to practice
any of the arts they knew, especially weaving, which could have been
carried on out of doors, as is done still occasionally, but subject to
many interruptions. It is possible that a class of kivas was designed
for such ordinary purposes, though now one type of room seems to answer
all these various uses. In most of the existing kivas there are planks,
in which stout loops are secured, fixed in the floor close to the wall,
for attaching the lower beam of a primitive vertical loom, and
projecting vigas or beams are inserted into the walls at the time of
their construction as a provision for the attachment of the upper loom
poles. The planks or logs to which is attached the lower part of the
loom appear in some cases to be quite carefully worked. They are often
partly buried in the ground and under the edges of adjacent paving
stones in such a manner as to be held in place very securely against the
strain of the tightly stretched warp while the blanket is being made.

The holes pierced in the upper surface of these logs are very neatly
executed in the manner illustrated in Fig. 31,
which shows one of the orifices in section, together with the adjoining
paving stones. The outward appearance of the device, as seen at short
intervals along the length of the log, is also shown. Strips of buckskin
or bits of rope are passed through these U-shaped cavities, and then
over the lower pole of the loom at the bottom of the extended series of
warp threads. The latter can thus be tightened preparatory to the
operation of filling in with the woof. The kiva looms seem to be used
mainly for weaving the dark-blue and black blankets of diagonal and
diamond pattern, which form a staple article of trade with the Zuni and
the Rio Grande Pueblos. As an additional convenience for the practice of
weaving, one of the kivas of Mashongnavi is provided with movable seats.
These consist simply of single stones of suitable size and form. Usually
they are 8 or 10 inches thick, a&nbsp;foot wide, and perhaps 15 or 18 inches
long. Besides their use as seats, these stones are used in connection
with the edges of the stone slabs that cap the permanent benches of the
kiva to support temporarily the upper and lower poles of the blanket
loom while the warp is gradually wound around them. The large stones
that are incorporated into the side of the benches of some of the
Mashongnavi kivas have occasionally round, cup-shaped cavities, of about
an inch in diameter, drilled into them. These holes receive one end of a
warp stick, the other end, being supported in a corresponding hole of
the heavy, movable stone seat. The other warp stick is supported in a
similar manner, while the thread is passed around both in a horizontal
direction preparatory to placing and stretching it in a vertical
position for the final working of the blanket. A&nbsp;number of these
cup-shaped
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
<!--png 283-->
pits are formed along the side of the stone bench, to provide for
various lengths of warp that may be required. On the opposite side of
this same kiva a number of similar holes or depressions are turned into
the mud plastering of the wall. All these devices are of common
occurrence at other of the Tusayan kivas, and indicate the antiquity of
the practice of using the kivas for such industrial purposes. There is a
suggestion of similar use of the ancient circular kivas in an example in
Canyon de Chelly. At a small cluster of rooms, built partly on a rocky
ledge and partly on adjoining loose earth and rocky debris, a&nbsp;land slide
had carried away half of a circular kiva, exposing a well-defined
section of its floor and the debris within the room. Here the writer
found a number of partly finished sandals of yucca fiber, with the long,
unwoven fiber carefully wrapped about the finished portion of the work,
as though the sandals had been temporarily laid aside until the maker
could again work on them. A&nbsp;number of coils of yucca fiber, similar to
that used in the sandals, and several balls of brown fiber, formed from
the inner bark of the cedar, were found on the floor of the room. The
condition of the ruin and the debris that filled the kiva clearly
suggested that these specimens were in use just where they were found at
the time of the abandonment or destruction of the houses. No traces were
seen, however, of any structural devices like those of Tusayan that
would serve as aids to the weavers, though the weaving of the particular
articles comprised in the collection from this spot would probably not
require any cumbrous apparatus.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_5" id = "chapIV_3_2_5"><i>Kiva
ownership.</i></a>&mdash;The kiva is usually spoken of as being the home
of the organization which maintains it. Different kivas are not used in
common by all the inhabitants. Every man has a membership in some
particular one and he frequents that one only. The same person is often
a member of different societies, which takes him to different kivas, but
that is only on set occasions. There is also much informal visiting
among them, but a man presumes to make a loitering place only of the
kiva in which he holds membership.</p>

<p>In each kiva there is a kiva mungwi (kiva chief), and he controls to
a great extent all matters pertaining to the kiva and its membership.
This office or trust is hereditary and passes from uncle to nephew
through the female line&mdash;that is, on the death of a kiva chief the
eldest son of his eldest sister succeeds him.</p>

<p>A kiva may belong either to a society, a&nbsp;group of gentes, or an
individual. If belonging to a society or order, the kiva chief commonly
has inherited his office in the manner indicated from the “eldest
brother” of the society who assumed its construction. But the kiva chief
is not necessarily chief of the society; in fact, usually he is but an
ordinary member. A&nbsp;similar custom of inheritance prevails where the kiva
belongs to a group of gentes, only in that case the kiva chief is
usually chief of the gentile group.</p>

<p>As for those held by individuals, a&nbsp;couple of examples will
illustrate the Tusayan practice. In Hano the chief kiva was originally
built
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
<!--png 284-->
by a group of “Sun” gentes, but about 45 years ago, during an epidemic
of smallpox, all the people who belonged to the kiva died except one
man. The room fell into ruin, its roof timbers were carried off, and it
became filled up with dust and rubbish. The title to it, however, rested
with the old survivor, as all the more direct heirs had died, and he,
when about to die, gave the kiva to Kotshve, a&nbsp;“Snake” man from Walpi,
who married a Tewa (Hano) woman and still lives in Hano. This man
repaired it and renamed it Tokónabi (said to be a Pah-Ute term, meaning
black mountain, but it is the only name the Tusayan have for Navajo
Mountain) because his people (the “Snake”) came from that place. He in
turn gave it to his eldest son, who is therefore kiva mungwi, but the
son says his successor will be the eldest son of his eldest sister. The
membership is composed of men from all the Hano gentes, but not all of
any one gens. In fact, it is not now customary for all the members of a
gens to be members of the same kiva.</p>

<p>Another somewhat similar instance occurs in Sichumovi. A&nbsp;kiva,
abandoned for a long time after the smallpox plague, was taken
possession of by an individual, who repaired it and renamed it Kevinyáp
tshómo&mdash;Oak Mound. He made his friends its members, but he called
the kiva his own. He also says that his eldest sister’s son will succeed
him as chief.</p>

<p>In each village one of the kivas, usually the largest one, is called
(aside from its own special name) mungkiva&mdash;chief kiva. It is
frequented by the kimungwi&mdash;house or village chief&mdash;and the
tshaakmungwi&mdash;chief talker, councillor&mdash;and in it also the
more elaborate ceremonies are observed.</p>

<p>No women frequent any of the kivas; in fact they never enter them
except to plaster the walls at customary periods, or during the occasion
of certain ceremonies. Yet one at least of the Oraibi kivas was built
for the observances of a society of women, the Mamzrántiki. This and
another female society&mdash;Lalénkobáki&mdash;exist in all the other
villages, and on the occasion of their festivals the women are given the
exclusive use of one of the kivas.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_6" id = "chapIV_3_2_6"><i>Motives for building
a kiva.</i></a>&mdash;Only two causes are mentioned for building a new
kiva. Quarrels giving rise to serious dissensions among the occupants of
a kiva are one cause. An instance of this occurred quite recently at
Hano. The conduct of the kiva chief gave rise to dissensions, and the
members opposed to him prepared to build a separate room of their own.
They chose a gap on the side of the mesa cliff, close to Hano, collected
stones for the walls, and brought the roof timbers from the distant
wooded mesas; but when all was ready to lay the foundation their
differences were adjusted and a complete reconciliation was
effected.</p>

<p>The other cause assigned is the necessity for additional room when a
gens has outgrown its kiva. When a gens has increased in numbers
sufficiently to warrant its having a second kiva, the chief of the
gentile
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
<!--png 287-->
group, who in this case is also chief of the order, proposes to his kin
to build a separate kiva, and that being agreed to, he assumes the
direction of the construction and all the dedicatory and other
ceremonies connected with the undertaking. An instance of this kind
occurred within the last year or two at Oraibi, where the members of the
“Katchina” gentes, who are also members of the religious order of
Katchina, built a spacious kiva for themselves.</p>

<p>The construction of a new kiva is said to be of rare occurrence. On
the other hand, it is common to hear the kiva chief lament the decadence
of its membership. In the “Oak Mound” kiva at Sichumovi there are now
but four members. The young men have married and moved to their wives’
houses in more thriving villages, and the older men have died. The chief
in this case also says that some 2&nbsp;years ago the agent gave him a stove
and pipe, which he set up in the room to add to its comfort. He now has
grave fears that the stove is an evil innovation, and has exercised a
deleterious influence upon the fortune of his kiva and its members; but
the stove is still retained.</p>

<p><a name = "chapIV_3_2_7" id = "chapIV_3_2_7"><i>Significance of
structural plan.</i></a>&mdash;The designation of the curious orifice of
the sipapuh as “the place from which the people emerged” in connection
with the peculiar arrangement of the kiva interior with its change of
floor level, suggested to the author that these features might be
regarded as typifying the four worlds of the genesis myth that has
exercised such an influence on Tusayan customs; but no clear data on
this subject were obtained by the writer, nor has Mr. Stephen, who is
specially well equipped for such investigations, discovered that a
definite conception exists concerning the significance of the structural
plan of the kiva. Still, from many suggestive allusions made by the
various kiva chiefs and others, he also has been led to infer that it
typifies the four “houses,” or stages, described in their creation
myths. The sipapuh, with its cavity beneath the floor, is certainly
regarded as indicating the place of beginning, the lowest house under
the earth, the abode of Myuingwa, the Creator; the main or lower floor
represents the second stage; and the elevated section of the floor is
made to denote the third stage, where animals were created. Mr. Stephen
observed, at the New Year festivals, that animal fetiches were set in
groups upon this platform. It is also to be noted that the ladder
leading to the surface is invariably made of pine, and always rests upon
the platform, never upon the lower floor, and in their traditional
genesis it is stated that the people climbed up from the third house
(stage) by a ladder of pine, and through such an opening as the kiva
hatchway; only most of the stories indicate that the opening was round.
The outer air is the fourth world, or that now occupied.</p>

<p>There are occasional references in the Tusayan traditions to circular
kivas, but these are so confused with fantastic accounts of early mythic
structures that their literal rendition would serve no useful purpose in
the present discussion.</p>

difference between the end measurements of the same kiva are usually due
to the interior offsets that have been noticed on the plans, but the

DETAILS OF TUSAYAN AND CIBOLA CONSTRUCTION.</a></h5>

<h6><a name = "chapIV_4_1" id = "chapIV_4_1">
WALLS.</a></h6>

<p>The complete operation of building a wall has never been observed at
Zuñi by the writer, but a close examination of numerous finished and
some broken-down walls indicates that the methods of construction
adopted are essentially the same as those employed in Tusayan, which,
have been repeatedly observed; with the possible difference, however,
that in the former adobe mud mortar is more liberally used. A&nbsp;singular
feature of pueblo masonry as observed at Tusayan is the very sparing use
of mud in the construction of the walls; in fact, in some instances when
walls are built during the dry season, the larger stones are laid up in
the walls without the use of mud at all, and are allowed to stand in
this condition until the rains come; then the mud mortar is mixed, the
interstices of the walls filled in with it and with chinking stones, and
the inside walls are plastered. But the usual practice is to complete
the house at once, finishing it inside and out with the requisite
mortar. In some instances the outside walls are coated, completely
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
<!--png 292-->
covering the masonry, but this is not done in many of the houses, as may
be seen by reference to the preceding illustrations of the Tusayan
villages. At Zuñi, on the other hand, a&nbsp;liberal and frequently renewed
coating of mud is applied to the walls. Only one piece of masonry was
seen in the entire village that did not have traces of this coating of
mud, viz, that portion of the second story wall of house No.&nbsp;2 described
as possibly belonging to the ancient nucleus pueblo of Halona and
illustrated in <a href = "#plateLVIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LVIII</span></a>. Even the rough masonry of the kivas is
partly surfaced with this medium, though many jagged stones are still
visible. As a result of this practice it is now in many cases impossible
to determine from mere superficial inspection whether the underlying
masonry has been constructed of stone or of adobe; a&nbsp;difficulty that may
be realized from an examination of the views of Zuñi in Chapter <span
class = "smallroman">III</span>. Where the fall of water, such as the
discharge from a roof-drain, has removed the outer coating of mud that
covers stonework and adobe alike, a&nbsp;large proportion of these exposures
reveal stone masonry, so that it is clearly apparent that Zuñi is
essentially a stone village. The extensive use of sun-dried bricks of
adobe has grown up within quite recent times. It is apparent, however,
that the Zuñi builders preferred to use stone; and even at the present
time they frequently eke out with stonework portions of a house when the
supply of adobe has fallen short. An early instance of such
supplementary use of stone masonry still survives in the church
building, where the old Spanish adobe has been repaired and filled in
with the typical tabular aboriginal masonry, consisting of small stones
carefully laid, with very little intervening mortar showing on the face.
Such reversion to aboriginal methods probably took place on every
opportunity, though it is remarkable that the Indians should have been
allowed to employ their own methods in this instance. Although this
church building has for many generations furnished a conspicuous example
of typical adobe construction to the Zuñi, he has never taken the lesson
sufficiently to heart to closely imitate the Spanish methods either in
the preparation of the material or in the manner of its use. The adobe
bricks of the church are of large and uniform size, and the mud from
which they were made had a liberal admixture of straw. This binding
material does not appear in Zuñi in any other example of adobe that has
been examined, nor does it seem to have been utilized in any of the
native pueblo work either at this place or at Tusayan.

Where molded adobe bricks have been used by the Zuñi in housebuilding
they have been made from the raw material just as it was taken from the

abandoned for two centuries, has withstood the wear of time and weather

of a wall with adobe bricks. This example is very recent, as it has not
yet been roofed over. The top of the wall, however, is temporarily
protected by the usual series of thin sandstone slabs used in the
finishing of wall copings. The very rapid disintegration of native-made
adobe walls has brought about the use in Zuñi of many protective
devices, some of which will be noticed in connection with the discussion
of roof drains and wall copings. Figs. 32 and 33 illustrate a curious employment of pottery
fragments on a mud-plastered wall and on the base of a chimney to
protect the adobe coating against rapid erosion by the rains. These
pieces, usually fragments from large vessels, are embedded in the adobe
with the convex side out, forming an armor of pottery scales well
adapted to resist disintegration, by the elements.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of adobe in Zuñi should probably be
attributed to foreign influence, but the position of the village in the
open plain at a distance of several miles from the nearest outcrop of
suitable building stone naturally led the builders to use stone more
sparingly when an available substitute was found close at hand. The thin
slabs of stone, which had to be brought from a great distance, came to
be used only for the more exposed portions of buildings, such as copings
on walls and borders around roof openings. Still, the pueblo
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<!--png 296-->
builders never attained to a full appreciation of the advantages and
requirements of this medium as compared with stone. The adobe walls are
built only as thick as is absolutely necessary, few of them being more
than a foot in thickness. The walls are thus, in proportion, to height
and weight, sustained, thinner than the crude brick construction of
other peoples, and require protection and constant repairs to insure
durability. As to thickness, they are evidently modeled directly after
the walls of stone masonry, which had already, in both Tusayan and
Cibola, been pushed to the limit of thinness. In fact, since the date of
the survey of Zuñi, on which the published plan is based, the walls of
several rooms over the court passageway in the house, illustrated in <a
href = "#plateLXXXII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXII</span></a>,
have entirely fallen in, demonstrating the insufficiency of the thin
walls to sustain the weight of several stories.</p>

<p>The climate of the pueblo region is not wholly suited to the
employment of adobe construction, as it is there practiced. For several
months in the year (the rainy season) scarcely a day passes without
violent storms which play havoc with the earth-covered houses,
necessitating constant vigilance and frequent repairs on the part of the
occupants.</p>

<p>Though the practice of mud-coating all walls has in Cibola
undoubtedly led to greater carelessness and a less rigid adherence to
ancient methods of construction, the stone masonry may still be seen to
retain some of the peculiarities that characterize ancient examples.
Features of this class are still more apparent at Tusayan, and
notwithstanding the rudeness of much of the modern stone masonry of this
province, the fact that the builders are familiar with the superior
methods of the ancient builders, is clearly shown in the masonry of the

<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy characteristic of pueblo masonry, and one
which is more or less present in both ancient and modern examples, is
the use of small chinking stones for bringing the masonry to an even
face after the larger stones forming the body of the wall have been laid
in place. This method of construction has, in the case of some of the
best built ancient pueblos, such as those on the Chaco in New Mexico,
resulted in the production of marvelously finished stone walls, in which
the mosaic-like bits are so closely laid as to show none but the finest
joints on the face of the wall with but little trace of mortar. The
chinking wedges necessarily varied greatly in dimensions to suit the
sizes of the interstices between the larger stones of the wall. The use
of stone in this manner no doubt suggested the banded walls that form so
striking a feature in some of the Chaco houses. This arrangement was
likely to be brought about by the occurrence in the cliffs of seams of
stone of two degrees of thickness, suggesting to the builders the use of
stones of similar thickness in continuous bands. The ornamental effect
of this device was originally an accidental result of adopting the most
convenient method of using the material at hand. Though the masonry of
the modern pueblos does not afford examples of distinct bands, the

introduction of the small chinking spalls often follows horizontal lines
of considerable length. Even in mud-plastered Zuñi, many outcrops of
these thin, tabular wedges protrude from the partly eroded mudcoating of
a wall and indicate the presence of this kind of stone masonry. An
example is illustrated in Fig. 34, a&nbsp;tower-like
projection at the northeast corner of house No.&nbsp;2.</p>

mud mortar, were filled in or plugged with small fragments of stone,
which, after being partly embedded in the mud of the joint, were driven
in with unhafted stone hammers, producing a fairly even face of masonry,
afterward gone over with mud plastering of the consistency of modeling
clay, applied a handful at a time. Piled up on the ground near the new
house at convenient points for the builders may be seen examples of the
larger wall stones, indicating the marked tabular character of the
pueblo masons’ material. The narrow edges of similar stones are visible
in the unplastered portions of the house wall, which also illustrates
the relative proportion of chinking stones. This latter, however, is a
variable feature. <a href = "#plateXV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XV</span></a> affords a clear illustration of the
proportion of these small stones in the old masonry of Payupki; while in
<a href = "#plateXI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XI</span></a>,
illustrating a portion of the outer wall of the Fire House, the tablets
are fewer in number and thinner, their use predominating in the
horizontal joints, as in the best of the old examples, but not to the
same extent. <a href = "#fig35">Fig. 35</a> illustrates the inner face
of an unplastered wall of a small house at Ojo Caliente, in which the
modern method of using the chinking stones is shown. This example bears
a strong resemblance to the Payupki masonry illustrated in <a href =
"#plateXV">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XV</span></a> in the
irregularity with which the chinking stones are distributed in the
joints of the wall. The same room affords an illustration of a
cellar-like feature having the appearance of an intentional excavation
to attain a depth for this room

corresponding to the adjoining floor level, but this effect is due
simply to a clever adaptation of the house wall to an existing ledge of
sandstone. The latter has had scarcely any artificial treatment beyond
the partial smoothing of the rock in a few places and the cutting out of
a small niche from the rocky wall. This niche occupies about the same
position in this room that it does in the ordinary pueblo house. It is
remarkable that the pueblo builders did not to a greater extent utilize
their skill in working stone in the preparation of some of the irregular
rocky sites that they have at times occupied for the more convenient
reception of their wall foundations; but in nearly all such cases the
buildings have been modified to suit the ground. An example of this
practice is illustrated in <a href = "#plateXXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XXIII</span></a>, from the west side of Walpi. In some of
the ancient examples the labor required to so prepare the sites would
not have exceeded that expended on the massive masonry composed of
numberless small stones. Many of the older works testify to the
remarkable patience and industry of the builders in amassing and
carefully adjusting vast quantities of building materials, and the
modern Indians of Tusayan and Cibola have inherited much of this ancient
spirit; yet this industry was rarely diverted to the excavation of room
or village sites, except in the case of the kivas, in which special
motives led to the practice. In some of the Chaco pueblos, as now seen,
the floors of outer marginal rooms seem to be depressed below the
general level of the surrounding soil; but it is now difficult to
determine whether such was the original arrangement, as much sand and
soil have drifted against the outer walls, raising the surface. In none
of the pueblos within the limits of the provinces under discussion has
there been found any evidence of the existence of underground cellars;
the rooms that answer such purpose are built on the level of the ground.
At Tusayan the ancient practice of using the ground-floor rooms for
storage still prevails. In these are kept the dried fruit, vegetables,
and meats that constitute the principal winter food of the Tusayan.
Throughout Tusayan the walls of the first terrace rooms are not finished
with as much care as those above that face the open courts. A&nbsp;quite
smoothly finished coat of adobe is often seen in the upper stories, but
is much more rarely applied to the rough masonry of the ground-floor
rooms. At Zuñi no such difference of treatment is to be seen, a&nbsp;result
of the recent departure from their original defensive use. At the
present day most of the rooms that are built on the ground have external
doors, often of large size, and are regarded by the Zuñi as preferable
to the upper terraces as homes. This indicates that the idea of
convenience has already largely overcome the traditional defensive
requirements of pueblo arrangement. The general finish and quality of
the masonry, too, does not vary noticeably in different portions of the
village. An occasional wall may be seen in which underlying stones may
be traced through the thin adobe covering, as in one of the walls of the
court illustrated in <a href = "#plateLXXXII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXXII</span></a>, but most of the walls have a fairly
smooth

<!--png 304-->
finish. The occasional examples of rougher masonry do not seem to be
confined to any particular portion of the village. At Tusayan, on the
other hand, there is a noticeable difference in the extent to which the
finishing coat of adobe has been used in the masonry. The villages of
the first mesa, whose occupants have come in frequent contact with the
eastern pueblo Indians and with outsiders generally, show the effect in
the adoption of several devices still unknown to their western
neighbors, as is shown in the discussion of the distribution of roof
openings in these villages, pp. <a href = "#page201">201</a>-<a href =
"#page208">208</a>. The builders of the first mesa seem also to have
imitated their eastern brethren in the free use of the adobe coating
over their masonry, while at the villages of the middle mesa, and
particularly at Oraibi, the practice has been comparatively rare,
imparting an appearance of ruggedness and antiquity to the
architecture.</p>

<p>The stonework of this village, perhaps approaches the ancient types
more closely than that of the others, some of the walls being noticeable
for the frequent use of long bond stones. The execution of the masonry
at the corners of some of the houses enforces this resemblance and
indicates a knowledge of the principles of good construction in the
proper alternation of the long stones. A&nbsp;comparison with the Kin-tiel
masonry
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXXIX</span>) will show this resemblance. As a rule in
pueblo masonry an upper house wall was supported along its whole length
by a wall of a lower story, but occasional exceptions occur in both
ancient and modern work, where the builders have dared to trust the
weight of upper walls to wooden beams or girders, supported along part
of their length by buttresses from the walls at their ends or by large,
clumsy pieces of masonry, as was seen in the house of Sichumovi. In an
upper story of Walpi also, partitions occur that are not built
immediately over the lower walls, but on large beams supported on
masonry piers. In the much higher terraces of Zuñi, the strength of many
of the inner ground walls must be seriously taxed to withstand the
superincumbent weight, as such walls are doubtless of only the average
thickness and strength of ground walls. The dense clustering of this
village has certainly in some instances thrown the weight of two, three,
or even four additional, stories upon walls in which no provision was
made for the unusual strain. The few supporting walls that were
accessible to inspection did not indicate any provision in their
thickness for the support of additional weight; in fact, the builders of
the original walls could have no knowledge of their future requirements
in this respect. In the pueblos of the Chaco upper partition walls were,
in a few instances, supported directly on double girders, two posts of
12 or 14 inches in diameter placed side by side, without reinforcement
by stone piers or buttresses, the room below being left wholly
unobstructed. This construction was practicable for the careful builders
of the Chaco, but an attempt by the Tusayan to achieve the same result
would probably end in disaster. It was quite common among the ancient
builders to divide the ground or storage floor into smaller rooms than
the floor above, still preserving the vertical alignment of the
walls.</p>

The finish of pueblo masonry rarely went far beyond the two leading
forms, to which attention has been called, the free use of adobe on the
one hand and the banded arrangement of ancient masonry on the other.
These types appear to present development along divergent lines. The
banded feature doubtless reached such a point of development in the
Chaco pueblos that its decorative value began to be appreciated, for it
is apparent that its elaboration has extended far beyond the
requirements of mere utility. This point would never have been reached
had the practice prevailed of covering the walls with a coating of mud.
The cruder examples of banded construction, however&mdash;those that
still kept well within constructional expediency&mdash;were doubtless
covered with a coating of plaster where they occurred inside of the
rooms. At Tusayan and Cibola, on the other hand, the tendency has been
rather to elaborate the plastic element of the masonry. The nearly
universal use of adobe is undoubtedly largely responsible for the more
slovenly methods of building now in vogue, as it effectually conceals
careless construction. It is not to be expected that walls would be
carefully constructed of banded stonework when they were to be
subsequently covered with mud. The elaboration of the use of adobe and
its employment as a periodical coating for the dwellings, probably
developed gradually into the use of a whitewash for the house walls,
resulting finally in crude attempts at wall decoration.</p>

<p>Many of the interiors in Zuñi are washed with a coating of white,
clayey gypsum, used in the form of a solution made by dissolving in hot
water the lumps of the raw material, found in many localities. The
mixture is applied to the walls while hot, and is spread by means of a
rude glove-like sack, made of sheep or goat skin, with the hair side
out. With this primitive brush the Zuñi housewives succeed in laying on
a smooth and uniform coating over the plaster. An example of this class
of work was observed in a room of house No.&nbsp;2. It is difficult to
determine to what extent this idea is aboriginal; as now employed it has
doubtless been affected by the methods of the neighboring Spanish
population, among whom the practice of white-coating the adobe houses
inside and out is quite common. Several traces of whitewashing have been
found among the cliff-dwellings of Canyon de Chelly, notably at the ruin
known as Casa Blanca, but as some of these ruins contained evidences of
post-Spanish occupation, the occurrence there of the whitewash does not
necessarily imply any great antiquity for the practice.</p>

<p>External use of this material is much rarer, particularly in Zuñi,
where only a few walls of upper stories are whitened. Where it is not
protected from the rains by an overhanging coping or other feature, the
finish is not durable. Occasionally where a doorway or other opening has
been repaired the evidences of patchwork are obliterated by a
surrounding band of fresh plastering, varying in width from 4&nbsp;inches to
a foot or more. Usually this band is laid on as a thick wash of adobe,
but in some instances a decorative effect is attained by using white. It

<!--png 308-->
is curious to find that at Tusayan the decorative treatment of the
finishing wash has been carried farther than at Zuñi. The use of a
darker band of color about the base of a whitewashed room has already
been noticed in the description of a Tusayan interior. On many of the
outer walls of upper stories the whitewash has been stopped within a
foot of the coping, the unwhitened portion of the walls at the top
having the effect of a frieze. In a second story house of Mashongnavi,
that had been carefully whitewashed, additional decorative effect was
produced by tinting a broad band about the base of the wall with an
application of bright pinkish clay, which was also carried around the
doorway as an enframing band, as in the case of the Zuñi door above
described. The angles on each side, at the junction of the broad base
band with the narrower doorway border, were filled in with a design of
alternating pink and white squares. This doorway is illustrated in
Fig. 36. Farther north, on the same terrace, the
jamb of a whitewashed doorway was decorated with the design shown on the
right hand side of Fig. 36, executed also in pink
clay. This design closely resembles a pattern that is commonly
embroidered upon the large white “kachina,” or ceremonial blankets. It
is not known whether the device is here regarded as having any special
significance. The pink clay in which these designs have been executed
has in Sichumovi been used for the coating of an entire house front.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned uses of stone and earth in the
masonry of house walls, the pueblo builders have employed both these
materials in a more primitive manner in building the walls of corrals
and gardens, and for other purposes. The small terraced gardens of Zuñi,
located on the borders of the village on the southwest and southeast
sides, close to the river bank, are each surrounded by walls 2½ or 3
feet high, of very light construction, the average thickness not
exceeding 6 or 8 inches. These rude walls are built of small,
irregularly rounded lumps of adobe, formed by hand, and coarsely
plastered with mud. When the crops are gathered in the fall the walls
are broken down in places to facilitate access to the inclosures, so
that they require repairing at each planting season. Aside from this
they are so frail as to require frequent repairs throughout the period
of their use. This method of building walls was adopted because it was
the readiest and
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
<!--png 310-->
least laborious means of inclosing the required space. The character of
these garden walls is illustrated in Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">XC</span>, and their construction with rough
lumps of crude adobe shows also the contrast between the weak appearance
of this work and the more substantial effect of the masonry of the
adjoining unfinished house. At the Cibolan farming pueblos inclosing
walls were usually made of stone, as were also those of Tusayan. <a href

the manner in which the material has been used in the corrals of
Pescado, located within the village. The stone walls are used in
combination with stakes, such as are employed at the main pueblo.</p>

<p>Small inclosed gardens, like those of Zuñi, occur at several points
in Tusayan. The thin walls are made of dry masonry, quite as rude in
character as those inclosing the Zuñi gardens. The smaller clusters are
usually located in the midst of large areas of broken stone that has
fallen from the mesa above. In the foreground of <a href =

a number of examples of such work. Pl. <span class

<p>Where exceptionally large blocks of stone are available they have
been utilized in an upright position, and occur at greater or less
intervals along the thin walls of dry masonry. An example of this use
was seen in a garden wall on the west side of Walpi, where the stones
had been set on end in the yielding surface of a sandy slope among the
foothills. A&nbsp;similar arrangement, occurring close to the houses at Ojo
Caliente, is illustrated in Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XCII</span>. Large, upright slabs of stone have been
used by the pueblo builders in many ways, sometimes incorporated into
the architecture of the houses, and again in detached positions at some
distance from the villages. Pls. <a href = "#plateXCIII"><span class =
"smallroman">XCIII</span></a> and <a href = "#plateXCIV"><span class =
"smallroman">XCIV</span></a>, drawn from the photographs of Mr.
W.&nbsp;H. Jackson, afford illustrations of this usage in the ancient
ruins of Montezuma Canyon. In the first of these cases the stones were
utilized, apparently, in house masonry. Among the ruins in the valley of
the San Juan and its tributaries, as described by Messrs. W.&nbsp;H.
Holmes and W.&nbsp;H. Jackson, varied arrangements of upright slabs of
stone are of frequent occurrence. The rows of stones are sometimes
arranged in squares, sometimes in circles, and occasionally are
incorporated into the walls of ordinary masonry, as in the example
illustrated. Isolated slabs are also met with among the ruins. At
K’iakima, at a point near the margin of the ruin, occurs a series of
very large, upright slabs, which occupy the positions of headstones to a
number of small inclosures, thought to be mortuary, outlined upon the
ground. These have been already described in connection with the ground
plan of this village.</p>

<p>The employment of upright slabs of stone to mark graves probably
prevailed to some extent in ancient practice, but other uses suggest
themselves. Occupying a conspicuous point in the village of Kin-tiel (<a
href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXIII</span></a>) is
an upright slab of sandstone which seems to stand in its original
position undisturbed, though the walls of the adjoining rooms

are in ruins. A&nbsp;similar feature was seen at Peñasco Blanco, on the east
side of the village and a short distance without the inclosing wall.
Both these rude pillars are, in character and in position, very similar
to an upright stone of known use at Zuñi. A&nbsp;hundred and fifty feet from
this pueblo is a large upright block of sandstone, which is said to be
used as a datum point in the observations of the sun made by a priest of
Zuñi for the regulation of the time for planting and harvesting, for
determining the new year, and for fixing the dates of certain other
ceremonial observances. By the aid of such devices as the native priests
have at their command they are enabled to fix the date of the winter
solstice with a fair degree of accuracy. Such rude determination of time
was probably an aboriginal invention, and may have furnished the motive
in other cases for placing stone pillars in such unusual positions. The
explanation of the governor of Zuñi for a sun symbol seen on an upright
stone at Matsaki has been given in the description of that place. Single
slabs are also used, as seen in the easternmost room group of
Tâaaiyalana, and in the southwestern cluster on the same mesa, in the
building of shrines for the deposit of plume sticks and other ceremonial
objects.</p>

at Zuñi. The inclosing wall of the church yard, still used as a burial

stone set into the joints of a regular coping course that caps the wall.
This feature may have some connection with the idea of vertical grave
stones, noted at K’iakima. It is difficult to surmise what practical
purpose could have been subserved by these small upright stones.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the use of large stones for special purposes the
pueblo builders rarely appreciated the advantages that might be obtained
by the proper use of such material. Pueblo masonry is essentially made
up of small, often minute, constructional units. This restriction
doubtless resulted in a higher degree of mural finish than would
otherwise have been attained, but it also imposes certain limitations
upon their architectural achievement. Some of these are noted in the
discussion of openings and of other details of construction.</p>

<p>In the pueblo system of building, roof and floor is one; for all the
floors, except such as are formed immediately on the surface of the
ground, are at the same time the roofs and ceilings of lower rooms. The

at any point of the basal construction. The addition of rooms

Diagram of Zuñi roof construction.</p>

<p>The methods of roofing their houses practiced by the pueblo builders
varied but little, and followed the general order of construction that
has been outlined in describing Tusayan house building. The diagram,
shown in Fig. 37, an isometric projection
illustrating roof construction, is taken from a Zuñi example, the
building of which was observed by the writer. The roof is built by first
a series of principal beams or rafters. These are usually straight,
round poles of 6 or 8 inches in diameter, with all bark and projecting
knots removed. Squared beams are of very rare occurrence; the only ones
seen were those of the Tusayan kivas, of Spanish manufacture. In
recently constructed houses the principal beams are often of large size
and are very neatly squared off at the ends. Similar square ended beams
of large size are met with in the ancient work of the Chaco pueblos, but
there the enormous labor involved in producing the result with only the
aid of stone implements is in keeping with the highly finished character
of the masonry and the general massiveness of the construction. The same
treatment was adopted in Kin-tiel, as may be seen in <a href =
"#plateXCV">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XCV</span></a>, which
illustrates a beam resting upon a ledge or offset of the inner walls.
The recent introduction of improved mechanical aids has exerted a strong
influence on the character of the construction in greatly facilitating
execution. The use of the American ax made it a much easier task to cut
large timbers, and the introduction of the “burro” and ox greatly
facilitated their transportation. In the case of the modern pueblos,
such as Zuñi, the dwelling rooms that were built by families so poor as
not to have these aids would to some extent indicate the fact by their
more primitive construction, and particularly by their small size, in
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>

this respect more closely resembling the rooms of the ancient pueblos.
As a result the poorer classes would be more likely to perpetuate
primitive devices, through the necessity for practicing methods that to
the wealthier members of the tribe were becoming a matter of tradition
only. In such a sedentary tribe as the present Zuñi, these differences
of wealth and station are more marked than one would expect to find
among a people practicing a style of architecture so evidently
influenced by the communal principle, and the architecture of to-day
shows the effect of such distinctions. In the house of the governor of
Zuñi a new room has been recently built, in which the second series of
the roof, that applied over the principal beams, consisted of pine
shakes or shingles, and these supported the final earth covering without
any intervening material. In the typical arrangement, however,
illustrated in the figure, the first series, or principal beams, are
covered by another series of small poles, about an inch and a half or
two inches in diameter, at right angles to the first, and usually laid
quite close together. The ends of these small poles are partially
embedded in the masonry of the walls. In an example of the more careful
and laborious work of the ancient builders seen at Peñasco Blanco, on
the Chaco, the principal beams were covered with narrow boards, from 2
to 4 inches wide and about 1&nbsp;inch thick, over which was put the usual
covering of earth. The boards had the appearance of having been split
out with wedges, the edges and faces having the characteristic fibrous
appearance of torn or split wood. At Zuñi an instance occurs where split
poles have been used for the second series of a roof extending through
the whole thickness of the wall and projecting outside, as is commonly
the case with the first series. A&nbsp;similar arrangement was seen in a
ruined tower in the vicinity of Fort Wingate, New Mexico. In the typical
roof construction illustrated the second series is covered with small
twigs or brush, laid in close contact and at right angles to the
underlying series, or parallel with the main beams. <a href =
"#plateXCVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XCVI</span></a>,
illustrating an unroofed adobe house in Zuñi, shows several bundles of
this material on an adjoining roof. This series is in turn covered with
a layer of grass and small brush, again at right angles, which prepares
the frame for the reception of the final earth covering, this latter
being the fifth application to the roof. In the example illustrated the
entire earth covering of the roof was finished in a single application
of the material. It has been seen that at Tusayan a layer of moistened
earth is applied, followed by a thicker layer of the dry soil.</p>

<p>In ancient construction, the method of arranging the material varied
somewhat. In some cases series 3 was very carefully constructed of
straight willow wands laid side by side in contact. This gave a very
neat appearance to the ceiling within the room. Examples were seen in
Canyon de Chelly, at Mummy Cave, and at Hungo Pavie and Pueblo Bonito on
the Chaco.</p>

<p>The small size of available roofing rafters has at Tusayan brought
about a construction of clumsy piers of masonry in a few of the larger
rooms, which support the ends of two sets of main girders, and these in
turn carry series&nbsp;1, or the main ceiling beams of the roof. The girders
are generally double, an arrangement that has been often employed in
ancient times, as many examples occur among the ruins. The purpose of
such arrangement may have been to admit of the abutment of the ends of
series&nbsp;1, when the members of the latter were laid in contact. In
the absence of squared beams, which seem never to have been used in the
old work, this abutment could only be securely accomplished by the use
of double girders, as suggested in the following diagram, Fig.&nbsp;38.</p>

<p>The final roof covering, composed of clay, is usually laid on very
carefully and firmly, and, when the surface is unbroken, answers fairly
well as a watershed. A&nbsp;slight slope or fall is given to the roof. This
roof subserves every purpose of a front yard to the rooms that open upon
it, and seems to be used exactly like the ground itself. Sheepskins are
stretched and pegged out upon it for tanning or drying, and the
characteristic Zuñi dome-shaped oven is frequently built upon it. In
Zuñi generally upper rooms are provided only with a mud floor, although
occasionally the method of paving with large thin slabs of stone is
adopted. These are often somewhat irregular in form, the object being to
have them as large as possible, so that considerable ingenuity is often
displayed in selecting the pieces and in joining the irregular edges.
This arrangement, similar to that of the kiva floors of Tusayan, is
occasionally met with in the kivas.</p>

<p>In making excavations at Kin-tiel, the floor of the ground room in
which the circular door illustrated in <a href = "#plateC">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">C</span></a>, was found was paved with large,
irregular fragments of stone, the thickness of which did not average
more than an inch. Its floor, whose paving was all in place, was strewn
with broken, irregular fragments similar in character, which must have
been used as the flooring of an upper chamber.</p>

WALL COPINGS AND ROOF DRAINS.</a></h6>

<p>In the construction of the typical pueblo house the walls are carried
up to the height of the roof surface, and are then capped with a
continuous protecting coping of thin flat stones, laid in close contact,
their outer edges flush with the face of the wall. This arrangement is
still the prevailing one at Tusayan, though there is an occasional
example of the projecting coping that practically forms a cornice. This
latter is the more usual form at Zuñi, though in the farming pueblos of
Cibola
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
<!--png 319-->
it does not occur with any greater frequency than at Tusayan. The flush
coping is in Tusayan made of the thinnest and most uniform specimens of
building stone available, but these are not nearly so well adapted to
the purpose as those found in the vicinity of Zuñi.</p>

<p>Here the projecting stones are of singularly regular and symmetrical
form, and receive very little artificial treatment. Their extreme
thinness makes it easy to trim off the projecting corners and angles,
reducing them to such a form that they can be laid in close contact.
Thus laid they furnish an admirable protection against the destructive
action of the violent rains. The stones are usually trimmed to a width
corresponding to the thickness of the walls. Of course where a
projecting cornice is built, it can be made, to some extent, to conform
to the width of available coping stones. These can usually be procured,
however, of nearly uniform width. In the case of the overhanging
cornices the necessary projection is attained by continuing either the
main roof beams, or sometimes the smaller poles of the second series,
according to the position of the required cornice, for a foot or more
beyond the outer face of the wall. Over these poles the roofing is
continued as in ordinary roof construction with the exception that the
edge of the earth covering is built of masonry, an additional precaution
against its destruction by the rains. In many places the adobe
plastering originally applied to the faces of these cornices, as well as
to the walls, has been washed away, exposing the whole construction. In
some of these instances the face of the cornice furnishes a complete
section of the roof, in which all the series of its construction can be
readily identified. The protective agency of these coping stones is well
illustrated in <a href = "#plateXCVII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">XCVII</span></a>, which shows the destructive effect of
rain at a point where an open joint has admitted enough water to bare
the masonry of the cornice face, eating through its coating of adobe,
while at the firmly closed joint toward the left there has been no
erosive action. The much larger proportion of projecting copings or
cornices in Zuñi, as compared with Tusayan, is undoubtedly attributable
to the universal smoothing of the walls with adobe, and to the more
general use of this perishable medium in this village, and the
consequent necessity for protecting the walls. The efficiency of this
means of protecting the wall against the wear of weather is seen in the
preservation of external whitewashing for several feet below such a
cornice on the face of the walls. At the pueblo of Acoma a similar
extensive use of projecting cornices is met with, particularly on the
third story walls. Here again it is due to the use of adobe, which has
been more frequently employed in the finish of the higher and newer
portions of the village than in the lower terraces. As a rule these
overhanging copings occur <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘pricipally’">principally</ins>
on the southern exposures of the
buildings and on the terraced sides of house rows. When walls rise to
the height of several stories directly from the ground, such as the back
walls of house rows, they are not usually provided with this feature but
are capped with flush copings.</p>

The rapid and destructive erosion of the earthen roof covering must have
early stimulated the pueblo architect to devise means for promptly
distributing where it would do the least harm, the water which came upon
his house. This necessity must have led to the early use of roof drains,
for in no other way could the ancient builders have provided for the
effectual removal of the water from the roofs and at the same time have
preserved intact the masonry of the walls. Unfortunately we have no
examples of such features in the ruined pueblos, for in the destruction
or decay of the houses they are among the first details to be lost. The
roof drain in the modern architecture becomes a very prominent feature,
particularly at Zuñi.</p>

<p>These drains are formed by piercing an opening through the thickness
of the coping wall, at a point where the drainage from the roof would
collect, the opening being made with a decided pitch and furnished with
a spout or device of some kind to insure the discharge of the water
beyond the face of the wall. These spouts assume a variety of forms.
Perhaps the most common is that of a single long, narrow slab of stone,
set at a suitable angle and of sufficient projection to throw the
discharge clear of the wall. Fig. 39 illustrates
drains of this type, No.&nbsp;1 being a Tusayan example and No.&nbsp;2 from Zuñi.
It will be noted that the surrounding masonry of the former, as well as
the stone itself, are much ruder than the Zuñi example. Another type of
drain, not differing greatly from the preceding, is illustrated
in Fig. 40. This form is a slight improvement on the
single stone drain, as it is provided with side
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154" id = "page154"> </a>
<!--png 323-->
pieces which convert the device into a trough-like spout, and more
effectually direct the discharge. No.&nbsp;1 is a Tusayan spout and No.&nbsp;2 a
Zuñi example. Wooden spouts are also commonly used for this purpose.
Fig. 41 illustrates an example from each province of
this form of drain. These are usually made from small tree trunks, not
exceeding 3&nbsp;or 4 inches in diameter, and are gouged out from one side.
No tubular specimens of wooden spouts were seen. At Tusayan the builders
have utilized stone of a concretionary formation for roof drains. The
workers in stone could not wish for material more suitably fashioned for
the purpose than these specimens. Two of these curious stone channels
are illustrated in Fig. 42. Two more examples of
Tusayan roof drains are illustrated in Fig. 43.
The first of the latter shows the use of a discarded metate, or mealing
stone, and the second of a gourd that has been walled into the
coping.</p>

It is said that tubes of clay were used at Awatubi in olden times for
roof drains, but there remains no positive evidence of this. Three forms
of this device are attributed to the people of that village. Some are
said to have been made of wood, others of stone, and some again of
sun-dried clay. The native explanation of the use in this connection of
sun-dried clay, instead of the more durable baked product, was that the
application of fire to any object that water passes through would be
likely to dry up the rains. It was stated in this connection that at the
present day the cobs of the corn used for planting are not burned until
rain has fallen on the crop. If the clay spout described really existed
among the people at Awatubi, it was likely to have been an innovation
introduced by the Spanish missionaries. Among the potsherds picked up at
this ruin was a small piece of coarsely made clay tube, which seemed to
be too large and too roughly modeled to have been the handle of a ladle,
which it roughly resembled, or to have belonged to any other known form
of domestic pottery. As a roof drain its use would not accord with the
restrictions referred to in the native account, as the piece had been
burnt.</p>

<p>In some cases in Zuñi where drains discharge from the roofs of upper
terraces directly upon those below, the lower roofs and also the
adjoining vertical walls are protected by thin tablets of stone, as
shown in Fig. 44. It will be seen that one of
these is placed upon the lower roof in such a position that the drainage
falls directly upon it. Where the adobe roof covering is left
unprotected its destruction by the rain is very rapid, as the showers of
the rainy season in these regions, though usually of short duration, are
often extremely violent. The force of the torrents is illustrated in the
neighboring country. Here small ruts in the surface of the ground are
rapidly converted into large arroyos. Frequently ordinary wagon tracks
along a bit of valley slope serve as an initial channel to the rapidly
accumulating waters and are eaten

Zuñi roof drain, with splash stones on roof below.</p>

<p>The shiftlessness of the native builders in the use of the more
convenient material brings its own penalty during this season in a
necessity for constant watchfulness and frequent repairs to keep the
houses habitable. One can often see in Zuñi where an inefficient drain
or a broken coping has given the water free access to the face of a
plastered wall, carrying away all its covering and exposing in a
vertical space the jagged stones of the underlying masonry. It is
noticeable that much more attention has been paid to protective devices
at Zuñi than at Tusayan. This is undoubtedly due to the prevalent use of
adobe in the former. This friable material must be protected at all
vulnerable points with slabs of stone in order quickly to divert the
water and preserve the roofs and walls from destruction.</p>

LADDERS AND STEPS.</a></h6>

<p>In the inclosed court of the old fortress pueblos the first terrace
was reached only by means of ladders, but the terraces or rooms above
this were reached both by ladders and steps. The removal of the lower
tier of ladders thus gave security against intrusion and attack. The
builders of Tusayan have preserved this primitive arrangement in much
greater purity than those of Cibola.</p>

<p>In Zuñi numerous ladders are seen on every terrace, but the purpose
of these, on the highest terraces, is not to provide access to the rooms
of the upper story, which always have external doors opening on the
terraces, but to facilitate repairs of the roofs. At Tusayan, on the
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
<!--png 330-->
other hand, ladders are of rare occurrence above the first terrace,
their place being supplied by flights of stone steps. The relative
scarcity of stone at Zuñi, suitable for building material, and its great
abundance at Tusayan, undoubtedly account for this difference of usage,
especially as the proximity of the timber supply of the Zuñi mountains
to the former facilitates the substitution of wood for steps of
masonry.</p>

<p>The earliest form of ladder among the pueblos was probably a notched
log, a&nbsp;form still occasionally used. Figures 45 and 46 illustrate
examples of this type of ladder from Tusayan.</p>

A notched ladder from Oraibi, made with a modern axe, is shown. This
specimen has a squareness of outline and an evenness of surface not
observed in the ancient examples. The ladder from Mashongnavi,
illustrated on the left of Fig. 46, closely
resembles the Oraibi specimen, though the workmanship is somewhat ruder.
The example illustrated on the right of the same figure is from Oraibi.
This ladder is very old, and its present rough and weatherbeaten surface
affords but little evidence of the character of the implement used in
making&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The ladder having two poles connected by cross rungs is undoubtedly a
native invention, and was probably developed through a series of
improvements on the primitive notched type. It is described in detail in
the earliest Spanish accounts. Fig. 47
illustrates on the left the notched ladder, and on the right a typical
two-pole ladder in its most primitive form. In this case the rungs are
simply lashed to the uprights. The center ladder of the diagram is a
Mandan device illustrated by Mr. Lewis H. Morgan.<a class = "tag" name =

ladder is placed with its forked end on the ground, the reverse of the
Pueblo practice. It will readily be seen, on comparing these examples,
that an elongation of the fork which occurs as a constant accompaniment
of the notched ladder might eventually suggest a construction similar to
that of the Mandan ladder reversed. The function of the fork on the
notched ladder in steadying it when placed against the wall would be
more effectually performed by enlarging this feature.</p>

At one stage in the development of the form of ladder in common use
to-day the rungs were laid in depressions or notches of the vertical
poles, resembling the larger notches of the single ladder, and then
lashed on with thongs of rawhide or with other materials. Later, when
the use of iron became known, holes were burned through the side poles.
This is the nearly universal practice to-day, though some of the more
skillful pueblo carpenters manage to chisel out rectangular holes. The
piercing of the side poles, <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘particulary’">particularly</ins>
prevalent in Zuni, has brought
about a curious departure from the ancient practice of removing the
ladder in times of threatened danger. Long rungs are loosely slipped
into the holes in the side pieces, and the security formerly gained by
taking up the entire ladder is now obtained, partially at least, by the
removal of the rungs. The boring of the side pieces and the employment
of loose rungs seriously interferes with the stability of the structure,
as means must be provided to prevent the spreading apart of the side
pieces. The Zuni architect has met this difficulty by prolonging the
poles of the ladder and attaching a cross piece near their upper ends to
hold them together. As a rule this cross piece is provided with a hole
near each end into which the tapering extremities of the poles are
inserted. From their high position near the extremities of the ladders,
seen in silhouette against the sky, they form peculiarly striking
features of Zuni. They are frequently decorated with rude carvings of
terraced notches. Examples of this device may be seen in the views of
Zuni, and several typical specimens are illustrated in detail in <a href
= "#plateXCVIII">Pl.&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">XCVIII</span></a>.
The use of cross pieces on ladders emerging from roof openings is not so
common as on external ones, as there is not the same necessity for
holding together the poles, the sides of the opening performing that
office.</p>

<p>There are two places in Zuni, portions of the densest house cluster,
where the needs of unusual traffic have been met by the employment of
double ladders, made of three vertical poles, which accommodate two
tiers of rungs. The sticks forming the rungs are inserted in continuous
lengths through all three poles, and the cross pieces at the top are
also continuous, being formed of a single flat piece of wood perforated
by three holes for the reception of the tips of the poles. In additional
to the usual cross pieces pierced for the reception of the side poles
and rudely carved into ornamental forms, many temporary cross pieces are
added during the harvest season in the early autumn to support the
strips of meat and melons, strings of red peppers, and other articles
dried in the open air prior to storage for winter use. At this season
every device that will serve this purpose is employed. Occasionally
poles are seen extending across the reentering angles of a house or are
supported on the coping and rafters. The projecting roof beams also are
similarly utilized at this season.</p>

<p>Zuni ladders are usually provided with about eight rungs, but a few
have as many as twelve. The women ascend these ladders carrying ollas of
water on their heads, children play upon them, and a few of the

most expert of the numerous dogs that infest the village can clumsily
make their way up and down them. As described in a previous section all
houses built during the year are consecrated at a certain season, and
among other details of the ceremonial, certain rites, intended to
prevent accidents to children, etc., are performed at the foot of the
ladders.</p>

<p>In Tusayan, where stone is abundant, the ladder has not reached the
elaborate development seen in Zuñi. The perforated cross piece is rarely
seen, as there is little necessity for its adoption. The side poles are
held together by the top and bottom rungs, which pass entirely through
the side pieces and are securely fixed, while the ends of the others are
only partly embedded in the side pieces. In other cases (<a href =
"#plateXXXII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXXII</span></a>) the poles
are rigidly held in place by ropes or rawhide lashings.</p>

<p>Short ladders whose side poles are but little prolonged beyond the
top rung are of common occurrence, particularly in Oraibi. Three such
ladders are shown in <a href = "#plateLXXXIV">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXXXIV</span></a>. A&nbsp;similar example may be seen in
<a href = "#plateCVII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CVII</span></a>,
in connection with a large opening closed with rough masonry. In these
cases the rungs are made to occupy slight notches or depressions in the
upright poles and are then firmly lashed with rawhide, forming a fairly
rigid structure. This type of ladder is probably a survival of the
earliest form of the pueblo ladder.</p>

<p>The exceptional mode of access to Tusayan kiva hatchways by means of
short nights of stone steps has already been noticed. In several
instances the top steps of these short flights cover the thickness of
the wall. The remains of a similar stairway were observed in Pueblo
Bonito, where it evidently reached directly from the ground to an
external doorway. Access by such means, however, is a departure from the
original defensive idea.</p>

Perhaps in no one detail of pueblo construction are the careless and
shiftless modern methods so conspicuous as in the stone steps of the
upper terraces of Tusayan. Here are seen many awkward makeshifts by
means of which the builders have tried to compensate for their lack of
foresight in planning. The absence of a definite plan for a house
cluster of many rooms, already noted in the discussion of dwelling-house
construction, is rendered conspicuous by the manner in which the stone
stairways are used. Figs. <a href = "#fig48">48</a> and 49 illustrate
stone steps on upper terraces in Oraibi. In
both cases the steps have been added long after the rooms against which
they abut were built. In order to conform to the fixed requirement of
placing such means of access at the corners of the upper rooms, the
builders constructed a clumsy platform to afford passage around the
previously built chimney. Fig. 50 shows the
result of a similar lack of foresight. The upper portion of the flight,
consisting of three steps, has been abruptly turned at right angles to
the main flight, and is supported upon rude poles and beams. The
restriction of this feature to the corners of upper rooms where they
were most likely to conflict with chimneys is undoubtedly a survival of
ancient practice, and due to the necessary vertical alignment of walls
and masonry in this primitive construction.</p>

Cibola the large dome-shaped ovens, common to the Pueblos of the Rio

with a coating of mud. The pit is usually of small size and is commonly
placed at some little distance from the house; in a few cases it is
located in a sheltered corner of the building. Fig.
51 illustrates a series of three such primitive ovens built against
a house wall, in a low bench or ledge of masonry raised 6&nbsp;inches above
the ground; the holes measure about a foot across and are about 18 or 20
inches deep. Many similar pits occur in the Tusayan villages; some of
them are walled in with upright stone slabs, whose rough edges project 6
or 8 inches above the ground, the result closely resembling the ancient
form of in-door fireplace, such as that seen in a room of Kin-tiel.

These occur on the east side of Mashongnavi. They project 6 or 8 inches
above the ground, and have a depth of from 18 to 24 inches. The débris
scattered about the pits indicates the manner in which they are covered
with slabs of stone and sealed with mud when in use. In all the oven,
devices of the pueblos the interior is first thoroughly heated by a long
continued fire within, the structure. When the temperature is
sufficiently high the ashes and dirt are cleaned out, the articles to be
cooked inserted, and the orifices sealed. The food is often left in
these heated receptacles for 12 hours or more, and on removal it is
generally found to be very nicely cooked. Each of the pi-gummi ovens
illustrated above is provided with a tube-like orifice 3&nbsp;or 4 inches in
diameter, descending obliquely from the ground level into the cavity.
Through this opening the fire is arranged and kept in order, and in this
respect it seems to be the counterpart of the smaller hole of the Zuñi
dome-shaped ovens. When the principal opening, by which the vessel
containing the pi-gummi or other articles is introduced, has been
covered with a slab of stone and sealed with mud, the effect is similar
to that of the dome-shaped oven when the ground-opening or doorway is
hermetically closed.</p>

<p>No example of the dome-shaped oven of pre-Columbian origin has been
found among the pueblo ruins, although its prototype probably existed in
ancient times, possibly in the form of a kiln for baking a fine quality
of pottery formerly manufactured. However, the cooking pit alone,
developed to the point of the pi-gummi oven of Tusayan, may have been
the stem upon which the foreign idea was engrafted. Instances of the
complete adoption by these conservative people of a wholly foreign idea
or feature of construction are not likely to be found, as improvements
are almost universally confined to the mere modification of existing
devices. In the few instances in which more radical changes are
attempted the resulting forms bear evidence of the fact.</p>

<p>In Cibola the construction of a dome-shaped oven is begun by laying
out roughly a circle of flat stones as a foundation. Upon these the

upper structure is rudely built of stones laid in the mud and
approximately in the courses, though often during construction one side
will be carried considerably higher than another. The walls curve inward
to an apparently unsafe degree, but the mud mortar is often allowed to
partly dry before carrying the overhanging portion so far as to endanger
the structure, and accidents rarely happen. The oven illustrated in <a
href = "#plateXCVII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XCVII</span></a>

referred to. Typical examples of the dome oven occur in the foreground

warming

the dwelling. It was placed in the center of the floor in order that the
occupants of the house might conveniently gather around it. One of the
first improvements made in this shallow indoor cooking pit must have
consisted in surrounding it with a wall of sufficient height to protect
the fire against drafts, as seen in the outdoor pits of Tusayan. In
excavating a room in the ancient pueblo of Kin-tiel, a&nbsp;completely
preserved fireplace, about a foot deep, and walled in with thin slabs of
stone set on edge, was brought to light. The depression had been
hollowed out of the solid rock.</p>

<p>This fireplace, together with the room in which it was found, is
illustrated in <a href = "#plateC">Pl. <span class =

rectangular form, but other examples have been found which are circular.
Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Jackson describes a fireplace in a cliff dwelling in
“Echo Cave” that consisted of a circular, basin-like depression 30
inches across and 10 inches deep. Rooms furnishing evidence that fires
were made in the corners against the walls are found in many cliff
dwellings; the smoke escaped overhead, and the blackened walls afford no
trace of a chimney or flue of any kind.</p>

<p>The pueblo chimney is undoubtedly a post-Spanish feature, and the
best forms in use at the present time are probably of very recent
origin, though they are still associated with fireplaces that have
departed little from the aboriginal form seen at Kin-tiel and elsewhere.
It is interesting to note, in this connection, that the ceremony
consecrating the house is performed in Tusayan before the chimney is
added, suggesting that the latter feature did not form a part of the
aboriginal dwelling.</p>

In Cibola a few distinct forms of chimney are used at the present time,
but in the more remote Tusayan the chimney seems to be still in the
experimental stage. Numbers of awkward constructions, varying from the
ordinary cooking pit to the more elaborate hooded structures, testify to
the chaotic condition of the chimney-building art in the latter
province.</p>

<p>Before the invention of a chimney hood, and while the primitive
fireplace occupied a central position in the floor of the room, the
smoke probably escaped through the door and window openings. Later a
hole in the roof provided an exit, as in the kivas of to-day, where
ceremonial use has perpetuated an arrangement long since superseded in
dwelling-house construction. The comfort of a dwelling room provided
with this feature is sufficiently attested by the popularity of the
modern kivas as a resort for the men. The idea of a rude hood or flue to
facilitate the egress of the smoke would not be suggested until the
fireplace was transferred from the center of a room to a corner, and in
the first adoption of this device the builders would rely upon the
adjacent walls for the needed support of the constructional members.
Practically all of the chimneys of Tusayan are placed in corners at the
present time, though the Zuñi builders have developed sufficient skill
to construct a rigid hood and flue in the center of a side wall, as may
be seen in the view of a Zuñi interior, <a href = "#plateLXXXVI">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">LXXXVI</span></a>.</p>

<p>Although the pueblo chimney owes its existence to foreign suggestion
it has evidently reached its present form through a series of timid
experiments, and the proper principles of its construction seem to have
been but feebly apprehended by the native builders, particularly in
Tusayan. The early form of hood, shown in <a href =
"#fig66">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>, was made by placing a short supporting pole
across the corner of a room at a sufficient distance from the floor and
upon it arranging sticks to form the frame work of a contracting hood or
flue. The whole construction was finally covered with a thick coating of
mud. This primitive wooden construction has probably been in use for a
long time, although it was modified in special cases so as to extend
across the entire width of narrow rooms to accommodate “piki” stones or
other cumbersome cooking devices. It embodies the principle of roof
construction that must have been employed in the primitive house from
which the pueblo was developed, and practically constitutes a miniature
conical roof suspended over the fireplace and depending upon the walls
of the room for support. On account of the careful and economical use of
fuel by these people the light and inflammable material of which the
chimney is constructed does not involve the danger of combustion that
would be expected. The perfect feasibility of such use of wood is well
illustrated in some of the old log-cabin chimneys in the Southern
States, where, however, the arrangement of the pieces is horizontal, not
vertical. These latter curiously exemplify also the use of a miniature
section of house construction to form a conduit for the smoke, placed at
a sufficient height to admit of access to the fire.</p>

A further improvement in the chimney was the construction of a corner
hood support by means of two short poles instead of a single piece, thus
forming a rectangular smoke hood of enlarged capacity. This latter is
the most common form in use at the present time in both provinces, but
its arrangement in Tusayan, where it represents the highest achievement
of the natives in chimney construction, is much more varied than in
Cibola. In the latter province the same form is occasionally executed in
stone. Fig. 61 illustrates a corner hood, in
which the crossed ends of the supporting poles are exposed to view. The
outer end of the lower pole is supported from the roof beams by a cord
or rope, the latter being embedded in the mud plastering with which the
hood is finished. The vertically ridged character of the surface reveals
the underlying construction, in which light sticks have been used as a
base for the plaster. The Tusayans say that large sunflower stalks are
preferred for this purpose on account of their lightness. Figs. <a href
= "#fig63">63</a> and <a href = "#fig64">64</a> show another Tusayan
hood of the type described, and in <a href = "#fig69">Fig.&nbsp;69</a> a
large hood of the same general form, suspended over a piki-stone, is
noticeable for the frank treatment of the suspending cords, which are
clearly exposed to view for nearly their entire length.</p>

<p>In a chimney in a Mashongnavi house, illustrated in Fig. 62,
a&nbsp;simple, sharply curved piece of wood has been
used for the lower rim of this hood, thus obtaining all the capacity of
the two-poled form. The vertical sticks in this example are barely
discernible through the plastering, which has been applied with more
than the usual degree of care.</p>

A curious example illustrating a rudimentary form of two-poled hood is
shown in Fig. 63. A&nbsp;straight pole of unusual
length is built into the walls across the corner of a room, and its
insertion into the wall is much farther from the corner on one side than
the other. From the longer stretch of inclosed wall protrudes a short
pole that joins the principal one and serves as a support for one side
of the chimney-hood. In this case the builder appears to have been too
timid to venture on the bolder construction required in the perfected
two-poled hood. This example probably represents a stage in the
development of the higher form.</p>

<p>In some instances the rectangular corner hood is not suspended from
the ceiling, but is supported from beneath by a stone slab or a piece of
wood. Such a chimney hood seen in a house of Shupaulovi measures nearly
4 by 5 feet. The short side is supported by two stone slabs built into
the wall and extending from the hood to the floor. Upon the upper stone
rests one end of the wooden lintel supporting the long side, while the
other end, near the corner of the room, is held in position by a light
crotch of wood. Fig. 64 illustrates this hood;

<p>The builders of Tusayan appear to have been afraid to add the
necessary weight of mud mortar to produce this finished effect, the
hoods usually showing a vertically ridged or crenated surface, caused by
the sticks of the framework showing through the thin mud coat. Stone
also is often employed in their construction, and its use has developed
a large, square-headed type of chimney unknown at Tusayan. This is
illustrated in Fig. 65. This form of hood,
projecting some distance beyond its flue, affords space that may be used
as a mantel-shelf, an advantage gained only to a very small degree by
the forms discussed above. This chimney, as before stated, is built
against one of the walls of a room, and near the middle.</p>

<p>All the joints of these hoods, and even the material used, are
generally concealed from view by a carefully applied coating of plaster,
supplemented by a gypsum wash, and usually there is no visible evidence
of the manner in which they are built, but the construction is little
superior to that of the simple corner hoods. The method of framing the
various types of hoods is illustrated in Fig. 66.
The example on the left shows an unplastered wooden hood skeleton. The
arrangement of the parts in projecting rectangular stone hoods is
illustrated in the right-hand diagram of the figure. In constructing
such a chimney a thin buttress is first built against the wall of
sufficient width and
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
<!--png 362-->
height to support one side of the hood. The opposite side of the hood is
supported by a flat stone, firmly set on edge into the masonry of the
wall. The front of the hood is supported by a second flat stone which
rests at one end on a rude shoulder in the projecting slab, and at the
other end upon the front edge of the buttress. It would be quite
practicable for the pueblo builders to form a notch in the lower corner
of the supported stone to rest firmly upon a projection of the
supporting stone, but in the few cases in which the construction could
be observed no such treatment was seen, for they depended mainly on the
interlocking of the ragged ends of the stones. This structure serves to
support the body of the flue, usually with an intervening stone-covered
space forming a shelf. At the present period the flue is usually built
of thin sandstone slabs, rudely adjusted to afford mutual support. The
whole structure is bound together and smoothed over with mud plastering,
and is finally finished with the gypsum wash, applied also to the rest
of the room. Mr. A.&nbsp;F. Bandelier describes “a regular chimney, with
mantel and shelf, built of stone slabs,” which he found “in the caves of
the Rito de los Frijoles, as well as in the cliff dwellings of the
regular detached family house type,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =
"tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> which, from the description, must have
closely resembled the Zuñi chimney described above. Houses containing
such devices may be quite old, but if so they were certainly reoccupied
in post-Spanish times. Such dwellings are likely to have been used as
places of refuge in times of danger up to a comparatively recent
date.</p>

<p>Among the many forms of chimneys and fireplaces seen in Tusayan a
curious approach to our own arrangement of fireplace and mantel was
noticed in a house in Sichumovi. In addition to the principal mantel
ledge, a&nbsp;light wooden shelf was arranged against the wall on one side of
the flue, one of its ends being supported by an upright piece of wood
with a cap, and the other resting on a peg driven into the wall. This
fireplace and mantel is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;67.</p>

already noted in the outdoor cooking pits. A&nbsp;serious problem was
encountered by the Tusayan builder when he was called upon to construct
cooking-pit fireplaces, a&nbsp;foot or more deep, in a loom of an upper
terrace. As it was impracticable to sink the pit into the floor, the
necessary depth was obtained by walling up the sides, as is shown in
Fig. 68, which illustrates a second-story fireplace
in Mashongnavi. Other examples may be seen in the outdoor chimneys shown

A modification of the interior fireplace designed for cooking the thin,
paper-like bread, known to the Spanish-speaking peoples of this region
as “guyave,” and by the Tusayan as “piki,” is common to both Cibola and
Tusayan, though in the former province the contrivance is more carefully
constructed than in the latter, and the surface of the baking stone
itself is more highly finished. In the guyave oven a tablet of carefully
prepared sandstone is supported in a horizontal position by two slabs
set on edge and firmly imbedded in the floor. A&nbsp;horizontal flue is thus
formed in which the fire is built. The upper stone, whose surface is to
receive the thin guyave batter, undergoes during its original
preparation a certain treatment with fire and piñon gum, and perhaps
other ingredients, which imparts to it a highly polished black finish.
This operation is usually performed away from the pueblo, near a point
where suitable stone is found, and is accompanied by a ceremonial, which
is intended to prevent the stone from breaking on exposure to the fire
when first used. During one stage of these rites the strictest silence
is enjoined, as, according to the native account, a&nbsp;single word spoken
at such a time would crack the tablet.</p>

<p>When the long guyave stone is in position upon the edges of the back
and front stones the fire must be so applied as to maintain the stone at
a uniform temperature. This is done by frequent feeding with small bits
of sage brush or other fuel. The necessity for such economy in the use
of fuel has to a certain extent affected the forms of all the heating
and cooking devices. Fig. 69 illustrates a
Sichumovi piki stone, and Fig. 70 shows the use
of the oven in connection with a cooking fireplace, a&nbsp;combination that
is not uncommon. The latter example

is from Shumopavi. The illustration shows an interesting feature in the
use of a primitive andiron or boss to support the cooking pot in
position above the fire. This boss is modeled from the same clay as the
fireplace floor and is attached to it and forms a part of it. Mr.
Stephen has collected free specimens of these primitive props which had
never been attached to the floor. These were of the rudely conical form
illustrated in the figure, and were made of a coarsely mixed clay
thoroughly baked to a stony hardness.</p>

<p>Chimneys and fireplaces are often found in Tusayan in the small,
recessed, balcony-like rooms of the second terrace. When a deep
cooking-pit is required in such a position, it is obtained by building
up the sides, as in the indoor fireplaces of upper rooms. Such a
fireplace is illustrated in Fig. 71. A&nbsp;roofed
recess which usually occurs at one end of the first terrace, called
“tupubi,” takes its name from the flat piki oven, the variety of
fireplace generally built in these alcoves. The transfer of the
fireplace from the second-story room to the corner of such a
roofed-terrace alcove was easily accomplished, and probably led to the
occasional use of the cooking-pit, with protecting chimney hood on the
open and unsheltered roof. Fig. 72 illustrates a
deep cooking-pit on an upper

terrace of Walpi. In this instance the cooking pit is very massively
built, and in the absence of a sheltering “tupubi” corner is effectually
protected on three sides by mud-plastered stone work, the whole being
capped with the usual chimneypot. The contrivance is placed conveniently
near the roof hatchway of a dwelling room.</p>

in a similar manner. Several specimens were seen in which the cooking
pit of the ordinary depressed type, excavated near an inner corner of a
house wall, was provided with sheltering masonry and a chimney cap; but
such an arrangement is by no means of frequent occurrence. Fig. 73
illustrates an example that was seen on the east
side of Shumopavi. It will be noticed that in the use of this
arrangement on the ground&mdash;an arrangement that evidently originated
on the terraces&mdash;the builders have reverted to the earlier form of
excavated pit. In other respects the example illustrated is not
distinguishable from the terrace forms above described.</p>

<p>In the discussion of the details of kiva arrangement in Tusayan
(p.&nbsp;121) it was shown that the chimney is not used in any form in
these ceremonial chambers; but the simple roof-opening forming the
hatchway serves as a smoke vent, without the addition of either an
internal hood or an external shaft. In the Zuñi kivas the smoke also
finds vent through the opening that gives access to the chamber, but in
the framing of the roof, as is shown elsewhere, some distinction between
door and chimney is observed. The roof-hole is made double, one portion
accommodating the ingress ladder and the other intended to serve for the
egress of the smoke.</p>

<p>The external chimney of the pueblos is a simple structure, and
exhibits but few variations from the type. The original form was
undoubtedly a mere hole in the roof; its use is perpetuated in the
kivas. This primitive form was gradually improved by raising its sides
above the roof, forming a rudimentary shaft. The earlier forms are
likely to have been rectangular, the round following and developing
later short masonry shafts which were finally given height by the
addition of chimney pots. In Zuñi the chimney has occasionally developed
into a rather tall shaft, projecting sometimes to a height of 4&nbsp;or 5
feet above the roof. This is particularly noticeable on the lower
terraces of Zuñi, the chimneys of
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
<!--png 374-->
the higher rooms being more frequently of the short types prevalent in
the farming pueblos of Cibola and in Tusayan. The tall chimneys found in
Zuñi proper, and consisting often of four or five chimney pots on a
substructure of masonry, are undoubtedly due to the same conditions that
have so much influenced other constructional details; that is, the
exceptional height of the clusters and crowding of the rooms. As a
result of this the chimney is a more conspicuous feature in Zuñi than
elsewhere, as will be shown by a comparison of the views of the villages
given in Chapters <a href = "#chapIII"><span class =

<p>In Tusayan many of the chimneys are quite low, a&nbsp;single pot
surmounting a masonry substructure not more than 6&nbsp;inches high being
quite common. As a rule, however, the builders preferred to use a series
of pots. Two typical Tusayan chimneys are illustrated in Fig. 74.
Most of the substructures for chimneys in this
province are rudely rectangular in form, and clearly expose the rough
stonework of the masonry, while in Zuñi the use of adobe generally
obliterates all traces of construction. In both provinces chimneys are
seen without the chimney pot. These usually occur in clusters, simply
because the builder of a room or group of rooms preferred that form of
chimney. Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CI</span> illustrates a portion of the upper terraces
of Zuñi where a number of masonry chimneys are grouped together. Those
on the highest roof are principally of the rectangular form, being
probably a direct development from the square roof hole. The latter is
still sometimes seen with a rim rising several inches above the roof
surface and formed of slabs set on edge or of ordinary masonry. These
upper chimneys are often closed or covered with thin slabs of sandstone
laid over them in the same manner as the roof holes that they resemble.
The fireplaces to which some of them belong appear to be used for
heating the rooms rather than for cooking, as they are often disused for
long periods during the summer season.</p>

immediately behind the single pot chimney seen in the foreground. On the
extreme left of the figure is shown a chimney into which fire pots have
been incorporated, the lower ones being almost concealed from view by
the coating of adobe. A&nbsp;similar effect may be seen in the small chimney
on the highest roof shown in <a href = "#plateLVIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LVIII</span></a>. <a href = "#plateLXXXII">Pl. <span class
= "smallroman">LXXXII</span></a> shows various methods of using the
chimney pots. In one case the chimney is capped with a reversed
large-mouthed jar, the broken bottom serving as an outlet for the smoke.
The vessel usually employed for this purpose is an ordinary black
cooking pot, the bottom being burned out, or otherwise rendered unfit
for household use. Other vessels are occasionally used. <a href =
"#plateLXXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXIII</span></a> shows
the use, as the crowning member of the chimney, of an ordinary water
jar, with dark decorations on a white ground. A&nbsp;vessel very badly broken
is often made to serve in chimney building by skillful use of mud and
mortar. To facilitate smoke exit the upper pot is made to overlap the
neck of the one below by breaking out the bottom sufficiently. The
joining is not often visible, as it is usually coated with adobe. The
lower pots of a series are in many cases entirely embedded in the
adobe.</p>

<p>The pueblo builder has never been able to construct a detached
chimney a full story in height, either with or without the aid of
chimney pots; where it is necessary to build such shafts to obtain the
proper draft he is compelled to rely on the support of adjoining walls,
and usually seeks a corner. <a href = "#plateCI">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CI</span></a> shows a chimney of this kind that has been
built of masonry to the full height of a story. A&nbsp;similar example is
shown in the foreground of <a href = "#plateLXXVIII">Pl. <span class =

height of the adjoining story, but in this instance it is constructed
wholly of pots. <a href = "#plateLXXXV">Pl. <span class =

<p>The external chimney probably developed gradually from the simple
roof opening, as previously noted. The raised combing about trapdoors or
roof holes afforded the first suggestion in this direction. From this
developed the square chimney, and finally the tall round shaft, crowned
with a series of pots. The whole chimney, both internal and external,
excluding only the primitive fireplace, is probably of comparatively
recent origin, and based on the foreign (Spanish) suggestion.</p>

GATEWAYS AND COVERED PASSAGES.</a></h6>

<p>Gateways, arranged for defense, occur in many of the more
compactly-built ancient pueblos. Some of the passageways in the modern
villages of Tusayan and Cibola resemble these older examples, but most
of the narrow passages, giving access to the inner courts of the
inhabited villages, are not the result of the defensive idea, but are
formed by the crowding together of the dwellings. They occur, as a rule,
within the pueblo and not upon its periphery. Many of the terraces now
face outward and are reached from the outside of the pueblo, being in
marked contrast to the early arrangement, in which narrow passages to
inclose

<p>In the first of these the deep jambs of the opening are clearly
defined, but in the other two only low mounds of débris suggest the
gateway. In the ancient Cibolan pueblos, including those on the mesa of
Tâaaiyalana, no remains of external gateways have been found; the plans
suggest that the disposition of the various clusters approximated
somewhat the irregular arrangement of the present day. There are only
occasional traces, as of a continuous defensive outer wall, such as
those seen at Nutria and Pescado. In the pueblos of the Cibola group,
ancient and modern, access to the inner portion of the pueblo was
usually afforded at a number of points. In the pueblo of Kin-tiel,
however, occurs an excellent example of the defensive gateway. The jambs
and corners of the opening are finished with great neatness, as may be
seen in the illustration
(Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CIII</span>). This gateway or passage was roofed over,
and the rectangular depressions for the reception of cross-beams still
contain short stumps, protected from destruction by the masonry. The
masonry over the passageway in falling carried away part of the masonry
above the jamb corner, thus indicating continuity of bond. The ground
plan of this ruin (<a href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">LXIII</span></a>) indicates clearly the various points at
which access to the inner courts was obtained. On the east side a
noticeable feature is the overlapping of the boundary wall of the south
wing, forming an indirect entranceway. The remains do not indicate that
this passage, like the one just described, was roofed over. In some
cases the modern passageways, as they follow the jogs and angles of
adjoining rows of houses, display similar changes of direction. In
Shupaulovi, which preserves most distinctly in its plan the idea of the
inclosed court, the passageway at the south end of the village changes
its direction at a right angle before emerging into the court (<a href =
"#plateXXX">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXX</span></a>). This
arrangement was undoubtedly determined by the position of the terraces
long before the passageway was roofed over and built upon. <a href =
"#plateXXII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXII</span></a> shows the
south passageway of Walpi; the entrances are made narrower than the rest
of the passage by building buttresses of masonry at the sides. This was
probably done to secure the necessary support for the north and south
walls of the upper story. One of the walls, as maybe seen in the
illustration, rests directly upon a cross beam, strengthened in this
manner.</p>

One of the smaller inclosed courts of Zuñi, illustrated in <a href =
"#plateLXXXII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXII</span></a>, is
reached by means of two covered passages, bearing some general
resemblance to the ancient defensive entrances, but these houses,
reached from within the court, have also terraces without. The low
passage shown in the figure has gradually been surmounted by rooms,
reaching in some cases a height of three terraces above the openings;
but the accumulated weight finally proved too much for the beams and
sustaining walls&mdash;probably never intended by the builders to
withstand the severe test afterwards put upon them&mdash;and following
an unusually protracted period of wet weather, the entire section of
rooms above fell to the ground. This occurred since the surveying and
photographing. It is rather remarkable that the frail adobe walls
withstood so long the unusual strain, or even that they sustained the
addition of a top story at all.</p>

<p>In the preceding examples the passageway was covered throughout its
length by rooms, but cases occur in both Tusayan and Cibola in which
only portions of the roof form the floor of superstructures.
Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CIV</span> shows a
passage roofed over beyond the two-story portion of the building for a
sufficient distance to form a small terrace, upon which a ladder stands.
<a href = "#plateXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XXIII</span></a>
illustrates a similar arrangement on the west side of Walpi. The outer
edges of these terraces are covered with coping stones and treated in
the same manner as outer walls of lower rooms. In Zuñi an example of
this form of passage roof occurs between two of the eastern house rows,
where the rooms have not been subjected to the close crowding
characteristic of the western clusters of the pueblo.</p>

<p>In Zuñi many rooms of the ground story, which in early times must
have been used largely for storage, have been converted into
well-lighted, habitable apartments by the addition of external doors. In
Tusayan this modification has not taken place to an equal extent, the
distinctly defensive character of the first terrace reached by removable
ladders being still preserved. In this province a doorway on the ground
is always provided in building a house, but originally this space was
not designed to be permanent; it was left merely for convenience of
passing in and out during the construction, and was built up before the
walls were completed. Of late years, however, such doorways are often
preserved, and additional small openings are constructed for
windows.</p>

<p>In ancient times the larger doorways of the upper terraces were
probably never closed, except by means of blankets or rabbit-skin robes
hung over them in cold weather. Examples have been seen that seem to
have been constructed with this object in view, for a slight pole, of
the same kind as those used in the lintels, is built into the masonry of
the jambs a few inches below the lintel proper. Openings imperfectly
closed against the cold and wind were naturally placed in the lee walls
to avoid the prevailing southwest winds, and the ground plans of the
exposed mesa villages were undoubtedly influenced by this circumstance,
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
<!--png 382-->
the tendency being to change them from the early inclosed court type and
to place the houses in longitudinal rows facing eastward. This is
noticeable in the plans given in Chapter <span class =
"smallroman">II</span>.</p>

<p>Doorways closed with masonry are seen in many ruins. Possibly these
are an indication of the temporary absence of the owner, as in the
harvest season, or at the time of the destruction or abandonment of the
village; but they may have been closed for the purpose of economizing
warmth and fuel during the winter season. No provision was made for
closing them with movable doors. The practice of fastening up the doors
during the harvesting season prevails at the present time among the
Zuñi, but the result is attained without great difficulty by means of
rude cross bars, now that they have framed wooden doors. One of these is
illustrated in Fig. 75. These doors are usually
opened by a latch-string, which, when not hung outside, is reached by
means of a small round hole through the wall at the side of the door.
Through this hole the owner of the house, on leaving it, secures the
door by props and braces on the inside of the room, the hole being
sealed up and plastered in the same manner that other openings are
treated.</p>

<p>This curious arrangement affords another illustration of the survival
of ancient methods in modified forms. It is not employed, however, in
closing the doors of the first terrace; these are fastened by barring
from the inside, the exit being made by means of internal ladders to the
terrace above, the upper doors only being fastened in the manner
illustrated. In <a href = "#plateLXXIX">Pl. <span class =

hole. Fig. 75 shows a barred door. The plastering

hole instead of the entire opening was brought about by the introduction
of the wooden door, which in its present paneled form is of foreign
introduction, but in this, as in so many other cases, some analogous
feature which facilitated the adoption of the idea probably already
existed. Tradition points to the early use of a small door, made of a
single slab of wood, that closed the small rectangular wall niches, in
which valuables, such as turquoise, shell, etc., were kept. This slab,
it is said, was reduced and smoothed by rubbing with a piece of
sandstone. A&nbsp;number of beams, rafters, and roofing planks, seen in the
Chaco pueblos, were probably squared and finished in this way. The
latter examples show a degree of familiarity with this treatment of wood
that would enable the builders to construct such doors with ease. As
yet, however, no examples of wooden doors have been seen in any of the
pre-Columbian ruins.</p>

<p>The pueblo type of paneled door is much more frequently seen in
Cibola than in Tusayan, and in the latter province it does not assume
the variety of treatment seen in Zuñi, nor is the work so neatly
executed. The views of the modern pueblos, given in Chapters <a href =
"#chapIII"><span class = "smallroman">III</span></a> and <a href =
"#chapIV"><span class = "smallroman">IV</span></a>, will indicate the
extent to which this feature occurs in the two groups. In the
construction of a paneled door the vertical stile on one side is
prolonged at the top and bottom into a rounded pivot, which works into
cup-like sockets in the lintel and sill, as illustrated in Fig. 76.
The hinge is thus produced in the wood itself
without the aid of any external appliances.</p>

<p>It is difficult to trace the origin of this device among the pueblos.
It closely resembles the pivot hinges sometimes used in mediæval Europe
in connection with massive gates for closing masonry passages; in such
cases the prolonged pivots worked in cavities of stone sills and
lintels. The Indians claim to have employed it in very early times, but
no evidence on this point has been found. It is quite possible that the
idea was borrowed from some of the earlier Mormon settlers who came into
the country, as these people use a number of primitive devices which are
undoubtedly survivals of methods of construction once common in the
countries from which they came. Vestiges of the use of a pivotal hinge,
constructed on a much more massive scale than any of the pueblo
examples, were seen at an old fortress-like, stone storehouse of the
Mormons, built near the site of Moen-kopi by the first Mormon
settlers.</p>

<p>The paneled door now in use among the pueblos is rudely made, and
consists of a frame inclosing a single panel. This panel, when of large
size, is occasionally made of two or more pieces. These doors vary
greatly in size. A&nbsp;few reach the height of 5&nbsp;feet, but the usual height
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
<!--png 386-->
is from 3½ to 4 feet. As doors are commonly elevated a foot or more
above the ground or floor, the use of such openings does not entail the
full degree of discomfort that the small size suggests. Doors of larger
size, with sills raised but an inch or two above the floor or ground,
have recently been introduced in some of the ground stories in Zuñi; but
these are very recent, and the idea has been adopted only by the most
progressive people.</p>

<p><a href = "#plateXLI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">XLI</span></a>
shows a small paneled door, not more than a foot square, used as a blind
to close a back window of a dwelling. The smallest examples of paneled
doors are those employed for closing the small, square openings
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
<!--png 387-->
in the back walls of house rows, which still retain the defensive
arrangement so marked in many of the ancient pueblos. In some instances
doors occur in the second stories of unterraced walls, their sills being
5&nbsp;or 6 feet above the ground. In such cases the doors are reached by
ladders whose upper ends rest upon the sills. Elevated openings of this
kind are closed in the usual manner with a rude, single-paneled door,
which is often whitened with a coating of clayey gypsum.</p>

<p>Carefully worked paneled doors are much more common in Zuñi than in
Tusayan, and within the latter province the villages of the first mesa
make more extended use of this type of door, as they have come into more
intimate contact with their eastern brethren than other villages of the
group. Fig. 77 illustrates a portion of a Hano
house in which two wooden doors occur. These specimens indicate the
rudeness of Tusayan workmanship. It will be seen that the workman who
framed the upper one of these doors met with considerable difficulty in
properly joining the two boards of the panel and in connecting these
with the frame. The figure shows that at several points the door has
been reenforced and strengthened by buckskin and rawhide thongs. The
same device has been employed in the lower door, both in fastening
together the two pieces of the panel and in attaching the latter to the
framing. These doors also illustrate the customary manner of barring the
door during the absence of the occupant of the house.</p>

Paneled wooden doors in Hano.</p>

<p>The doorway is usually framed at the time the house is built. The
sill is generally elevated above the ground outside and the floor
inside, and the door openings, with a few exceptions, are thus
practically only large windows. In this respect they follow the
arrangement characteristic of the ancient pueblos, in which all the
larger openings are window-like doorways. These are sometimes seen on
the court margin of house rows, and frequently occur between
communicating rooms within the cluster. They are usually raised about a
foot and a half above the floor, and in some cases are provided with one
or two steps. In Zuñi, doorways between communicating rooms, though now
framed in wood, preserve the same arrangement, as may be seen in <a href
= "#plateLXXXVI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXVI</span></a>.</p>

<p>The side pieces of a paneled pueblo door are mortised, an achievement
far beyond the aboriginal art of these people. Fig.
78 illustrates the manner in which the framing is done. All the
necessary grooving, and the preparation of the projecting tenons is
laboriously executed with the most primitive tools, in many cases the
whole frame, with all its joints, being cut out with a small knife.</p>

<p>Doors are usually fastened by a simple wooden latch, the bar of which
turns upon a wooden pin. They are opened from without by lifting the

latch from its wooden catch, by means of a string passed through a small
hole in the door, and hanging outside. Some few doors are, however,
provided with a cumbersome wooden lock, operated by means of a square,
notched stick that serves as a key. These locks are usually fastened to
the inner side of the door by thongs of buckskin or rawhide, passed
through small holes bored or drilled through the edge of the lock, and
through the stile and panel of the door at corresponding points. The
entire mechanism consists of wood and strings joined together in the
rudest manner. Primitive as this device is, however, its conception is
far in advance of the aboriginal culture of the pueblos, and both it and
the string latch must have come from without. The lock was probably a
contrivance of the early Mormons, as it is evidently roughly modeled
after a metallic lock.</p>

<p>Many doors having no permanent means of closure are still in use.
These are very common in Tusayan, and occur also in Cibola, particularly
in the farming pueblos. The open front of the “tupubi” or balcony-like
recess, seen so frequently at the ends of first-terrace roofs in
Tusayan, is often constructed with a transom-like arrangement in
connection with the girder supporting the edge of the roof, in the same
manner in which doorways proper are treated. <a href = "#plateXXXII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXXII</span></a> illustrates a balcony in
which one bounding side is formed by a flight of stone steps, producing
a notched or terraced effect. The supporting girder in this instance is
embedded in the wall and coated over with adobe, obscuring the
construction. Fig. 79 shows a rude transom over
the supporting beam of a balcony roof in the principal house of Hano.
The upper doorway shown in this house has been partly walled in,
reducing its size somewhat. It is also provided with a small horizontal
opening over the main lintel, which, like the doorway, has been partly
filled with masonry. This upper transom often seems to have resulted
from carrying such openings to the full height of the story. The transom
probably originated from the spaces left between the ends of beams
resting on the main girder that spanned the principal opening (see <a
href = "#fig81">Fig. 81</a>). Somewhat similar balconies are seen in
Cibola, both in Zuñi and in the farming villages, but they do not assume
so much importance as in Tusayan. An example is shown in <a href =
"#plateCI">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">CI</span></a>, in which the
construction of this feature is clearly visible.</p>

<p>In the remains of the ancient pueblos there is no evidence of the use
of the half-open terrace rooms described above. If such rooms existed,
especially if constructed in the open manner of the Tusayan examples,
they must have been among the first to succumb to destruction. The
comparative rarity of this feature in Zuñi does not necessarily indicate
that it is not of native origin, as owing to the exceptional manner of
clustering and to prolonged exposure to foreign influence, this pueblo
exhibits a wider departure from the ancient type than do any of the
Tusayan villages. It is likely that the ancient builders, trusting to
the double protection of the inclosed court and the defensive first
terrace,

with small transom openings.</p>

<p>The transom-like opening commonly accompanying the large opening is
also seen in many of the inclosed doorways of Tusayan, but in some of
these cases its origin can not be traced to the roof constructions, as
the openings do not approach the ceilings of the rooms. In early days
such doorways were closed by means of large slabs of stone set on edge,
and these were sometimes supplemented by a suspended blanket. In severe
winter weather many of the openings were closed with masonry. At the
present time many doorways not provided with paneled doors
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
<!--png 394-->
are closed in such ways. When a doorway is thus treated its transom is
left open for the admission of light and air. The Indians state that in
early times this transom was provided for the exit of smoke when the
main doorway was closed, and even now such provision is not wholly
superfluous. Fig. 80 illustrates a large doorway
of Tusayan with a small transom. The opening was being reduced in size
by means of adobe masonry at the time the drawing was made.
Fig. 81 shows a double transom over a lintel composed of
two poles; a&nbsp;section of masonry separating the transom into two distinct
openings rests upon the lintel of the doorway and supports a roof-beam;
this is shown in the figure. Other examples of transoms may be seen in
connection with many of the illustrations of Tusayan doorways.</p>

<p>The transom bars over exterior doorways of houses probably bear some
relation to a feature seen in some of the best preserved ruins and still
surviving to some extent in Tusayan practice. This consists of a
straight pole, usually of the same dimensions as the poles of which the
lintel is made, extending across the opening from 2 to 6 inches below
the main lintel, and fixed into the masonry in a position to serve as a
curtain pole. Originally this pole undoubtedly served as a means of
suspension for the blanket or skin rug used in closing the opening, just
as such means are now used in the huts of the Navajo, as well as

<p>A most striking feature of doorways is the occasional departure from
the quadrangular form, seen in some ruined villages and also in some of
the modern houses of Tusayan. Fig. 82 illustrates
a specimen of this type found in a small cliff ruin, in Canyon de
Chelly. Ancient examples of this form of opening are distinguished by a
symmetrical disposition of the step in the jamb, while the modern doors
are seldom so arranged. A&nbsp;modern example from Mashongnavi
is shown in Fig. 83. This opening also illustrates the double or
divided transom. The beam ends shown in the figure project beyond the
face of the wall and support an overhanging coping or cornice. A&nbsp;door-like
window, approximating the symmetrical form described, is seen
immediately over the passage-way shown in <a href = "#plateXXII">Pl.
<span class = "smallroman">XXII</span></a>. This form is evidently the
result of the partial closing of a larger rectangular opening.</p>

<p>Fig. 84 shows the usual type of terraced
doorway in Tusayan, in which one jamb is stepped at a considerably
greater height than the other. In Tusayan large openings occur in which
only one jamb is stepped, producing an effect somewhat of that of the
large balcony openings with flights of stone steps at one side,
previously illustrated. An opening of this form is shown in Fig. 85.
Both of the stepped doorways,
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<a name = "page191" id = "page191"> </a>
<!--png 398-->
illustrated above, are provided with transom openings extending from one
roof beam to another. In the absence of a movable door the openings were
made of the smallest size consistent with convenient use. The stepped
form was very likely suggested by the temporary partial blocking up of
an opening with loose, flat stones in such a manner as to least impair
its use. This is still quite commonly done, large openings being often
seen in which the lower portion on one or both sides is narrowed by
means of adobe bricks or stones loosely piled up. In this connection it
may be noted that the secondary lintel pole, previously described as
occurring in both ancient and modern doorways, serves the additional
purpose of a hand-hold when supplies are brought into the house on the
backs of the occupants. The stepping of the doorway, while diminishing
its exposed area, does not interfere with its use in bringing in large
bundles, etc. Series of steps, picked into the faces of the cliffs, and
affording access to cliff dwellings, frequently have a supplementary
series of narrow and deep cavities that furnish a secure hold for the
hands. The requirements of the precipitous environment of these people
have led to the carrying of loads of produce, fuel, etc., on the back by
means of a suspending band passed across the forehead;
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>

this left the hands free to aid in the difficult task of climbing. These
conditions seem to have brought about the use, in some cases, of
handholds in the marginal frames of interior trapdoors as an aid in
climbing the ladder.</p>

<p>One more characteristic type of the ancient pueblo doorway remains to
be described. During the autumn of 1883, when the ruined pueblo of
Kin-tiel was surveyed, a&nbsp;number of excavations were made in and about
the pueblo. A&nbsp;small room on the east side, near the brink of the arroyo
that traverses the ruin from east to west, was completely cleared out,
exposing its fireplace, the stone paving of its floor, and other details
of construction. Built into an inner partition of this room was found a
large slab of stone, pierced with a circular hole of sufficient size for
a man to squeeze through. This slab was set on edge and incorporated
into the masonry of the partition, and evidently served as a means of
communication with another room. The position of this doorway and its
relation to the room in which it occurs may be seen from the
illustration in <a href = "#plateC">Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">C</span></a>, which shows the stone in situ. The doorway or
“stone-close” is shown in Fig. 86 on a sufficient
scale to indicate the degree of technical skill in the architectural
treatment of stone possessed by the builders of this old pueblo. The
writer visited Zuñi in October of the same season, and on describing
this find to Mr. Frank H. Cushing, learned that the Zuñi Indians still
preserved traditional knowledge of this device. Mr. Cushing kindly
furnished at the

Wizards,” a Zuñi folk-tale of the early occupancy of the valley of
Zuñi.</p>

<p>“‘How will they enter?’ said the young man to his wife. ‘Through the
stone-close at the side,’ she answered. In the days of the ancients, the
doorways were often made of a great slab of stone with a round hole cut
through the middle, and a round stone slab to close it, which was called
the stone-close, that the enemy might not enter in times of war.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cushing had found displaced fragments of such circular stone
doorways at ruins some distance northwest from Zuñi, but had been under
the impression that they were used as roof openings. All examples of
this device known to the writer as having been found in place occurred
in side walls of rooms. Mr. E.&nbsp;W. Nelson, while making collections
of pottery from ruins near Springerville, Arizona, found and sent to the
Smithsonian Institution, in the autumn of 1884, “a&nbsp;flat stone about 18
inches square with a round hole cut in the middle of it. This stone was
taken from the wall of one of the old ruined stone houses near
Springerville, in an Indian ruin. The stone was set in the wall between
two inner rooms of the ruin, and evidently served as a means of
communication or perhaps a ventilator. I&nbsp;send it on mainly as an example
of their stone-working craft.” The position of this feature in the
excavated room of Kin-tiel is indicated on the ground plan, <a href =
"#fig60">Fig. 60</a>, which also shows the position of other details
seen in the general view of the room, <a href = "#plateC">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">C</span></a>.</p>

<p>A small fragment of a “stone-close” doorway was found incorporated
into the masonry of a flight of outside stone steps at Pescado,
indicating its use in some neighboring ruin, thus bringing it well
within the Cibola district. Another point at which similar remains have
been brought to light is the pueblo of Halona, just across the river
from the present Zuñi. Mr. F.&nbsp;Webb Hodge, recently connected with
the Hemenway Southwestern Archeological Exposition, under the direction
of Mr. F.&nbsp;H. Cushing, describes this form of opening as being of
quite common occurrence in the rooms of this long-buried pueblo. Here
the doorways are associated with the round slabs used for closing them.
The latter were held in place by props within the room. No slabs of this
form were seen at Kin-tiel, but quite possibly some of the large slabs
of nearly rectangular form, found within this ruin, may have served the
same purpose. It would seem more reasonable to use the rectangular
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<a name = "page194" id = "page194"> </a>
<!--png 403-->
slabs for this purpose when the openings were conveniently near the
floors. No example of the stone-close has as yet been found in
Tusayan.</p>

<p>The annular doorway described above affords the only instance known
to the writer where access openings were closed with a rigid device of
aboriginal invention; and from the character of its material this device
was necessarily restricted to openings of small size. The larger
rectangular doorways, when not partly closed by masonry, probably were
covered only with blankets or skin rugs suspended from the lintel. In
the discussion of sealed windows modern examples resembling the
stone-close device will be noted, but these are usually employed in a
more permanent manner.</p>

<p>The small size of the ordinary pueblo doorway was perhaps due as much
to the fact that there was no convenient means of closing it as it was
to defensive reasons. Many primitive habitations, even quite rude ones
built with no intention of defense, are characterized by small doors and
windows. The planning of dwellings and the distribution of openings in
such a manner as to protect and render comfortable the inhabited rooms
implies a greater advance in architectural skill than these builders had
achieved.</p>

<p>The inconveniently small size of the doorways of the modern pueblos
is only a survival of ancient conditions. The use of full-sized doors,
admitting a man without stooping, is entirely practicable at the present
day, but the conservative builders persist in adhering to the early
type. The ancient position of the door, with its sill at a considerable
height from the ground, is also retained. From the absence of any
convenient means of rigidly closing the doors and windows, in early
times external openings were restricted to the smallest practicable
dimensions. The convenience of these openings was increased without
altering their dimensions by elevating them to a certain height above
the ground. In the ruin of Kin-tiel there is marked uniformity in the
height of the openings above the ground, and such openings were likely
to be quite uniform when used for similar purposes. The most common
elevation of the sills of doorways was such that a man could readily
step over at one stride. It will be seen that the same economy of space
has effected the use of windows in this system of architecture.</p>

<h6><a name = "chapIV_4_10" id = "chapIV_4_10">
WINDOWS.</a></h6>

<p>In the pueblo system of building, doors and windows are not always
clearly differentiated. Many of the openings, while used for access to
the dwellings, also answer all the purposes of windows, and, both in
their form and in their position in the walls, seem more fully to meet
the requirements of openings for the admission of light and air than for
access. We have seen in the illustrations in Chapters <a href =
"#chapIII"><span class = "smallroman">III</span></a> and <a href =
"#chapIV"><span class = "smallroman">IV</span></a>, openings of
considerable size so located in the face of the outer wall as to unfit
them for use as doorways, and others whose size is wholly inadequate,
but which are still provided with the typical though diminutive
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195" id = "page195"> </a>
<!--png 406-->
single-paneled door. Many of these small openings, occurring most
frequently in the back walls of house rows, have the jambs, lintels,
etc., characteristic of the typical modern door. However, as the
drawings above referred to indicate, there are many openings concerning
the use of which there can be no doubt, as they can only provide
outlook, light, and air.</p>

<p>In the most common form of window in present use in Tusayan and
Cibola the width usually exceeds the height. Although found often in
what appear to be the older portions of the present pueblos, this shape
probably does not date very far back. The windows of the ancient pueblos
were sometimes square, or nearly so, when of small size, but when larger
they were never distinguishable from doorways in either size or finish,
and the height exceeded the width. This restriction of the width of
openings was due to the exceptionally small size of the building stone
made use of. Although larger stones were available, the builders had not
sufficient constructive skill to successfully utilize them. The failure
to utilize this material indicates a degree of ignorance of mechanical
aids that at first thought seems scarcely in keeping with the
massiveness of form and the high degree of finish characterizing many of
the remains; but as already seen in the discussion of masonry, the
latter results were attained by the patient industry of many hands,
although laboring with but little of the spirit of cooperation. The
narrowness of the largest doors and windows in the ancient pueblos
suggests timidity on the part of the ancient builders. The apparently
bolder construction of the present day, shown in the prevailing use of
horizontal openings, is not due to greater constructive skill, but
rather to the markedly greater carelessness of modern construction.</p>

<p>The same contrast between modern and ancient practice is seen in the
disposition of openings in walls. In the modern pueblos there does not
seem to be any regularity or system in their introduction, while in some
of the older pueblos, such as Pueblo Bonito on the Chaco, and others of
the same group, the arrangement of the outer openings exhibits a certain
degree of symmetry. The accompanying diagram, Fig.
87, illustrates a portion of the northern outer wall of Pueblo
Bonito, in which the small windows of successive rooms, besides being
uniform in size, are grouped in pairs. The degree of technical skill
shown in the execution of the masonry about these openings is in keeping
with the precision with which the openings themselves are placed.

In marked contrast to the above examples is the slovenly practice of the
modern pueblos. There are rarely two openings of the same size, even in
a single room, nor are these usually placed at a uniform height from the
floor. The placing appears to be purely a matter of individual taste,
and no trace of system or uniformity is to be found. Windows occur
sometimes at considerable height, near or even at the ceiling in some
cases, while others are placed almost at the base of the wall; examples
may be found occupying all intermediate heights between these extremes.
Many of the illustrations show this characteristic irregularity, but
Pls. <a href = "#plateLXXIX"><span class = "smallroman">LXXIX</span></a>
and <a href = "#plateLXXXII"><span class =
"smallroman">LXXXII</span></a> of Zuñi perhaps represent it most
clearly.</p>

<p>The framing of these openings differs but little from that of the
ancient examples. The modern opening is distinguished principally by the
more careless method of combining the materials, and by the introduction
in many instances of a rude sash. A&nbsp;number of small poles or sticks,
usually of cedar, with the bark peeled off, are laid side by side in
contact, across the opening, to form a support for the stones and earth
of the superposed masonry. Frequently a particularly large tablet of
stone is placed immediately upon the sticks, but this stone is never
long enough or thick enough to answer the purpose of a lintel for larger
openings. The number of small sticks used is sufficient to reach from
the face to the back of the wall, and in the simplest openings the
surrounding masonry forms jambs and sill. American or Spanish influence
occasionally shows itself in the employment of sawed boards for lintels,
sills, and jambs. The wooden features of the windows exhibit a curiously
light and flimsy construction.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the windows, in both Tusayan and Cibola, are
furnished with glass at the present time. Occasionally a primitive sash
of several lights is found, but frequently the glass is used singly; in
some instances it is set directly into the adobe without any intervening
sash or frame. In several cases in Zuñi the primitive sash or frame has
been rudely decorated with incised lines and notches. An example of this
is shown in Fig. 88. The frame or sash is usually
built solidly into the wall. Hinged sashes do not seem to have been
adopted as yet. Often the introduction of lights shows a curious and
awkward compromise between aboriginal methods and foreign ideas.</p>

<p>Characteristic of Zuñi windows, and also of those of the neighboring
pueblo of Acoma, is the use of semitranslucent slabs of selenite, about
1 inch in thickness and of irregular form. Pieces are occasionally met
with about 18 inches long and 8 or 10 inches

wide, but usually they are much smaller and very irregular in outline.
For windows pieces are selected that approximately fit against each
other, and thin, flat strips of wood are fixed in a vertical position in
the openings to serve as supports for the irregular fragments of
selenite, which could not be retained in place without some such
provision. The use of window openings at the bases of walls probably
suggested this use of vertical sticks as a support to slabs of selenite,
as in this position they would be particularly useful, the windows being
generally arranged on a slope, as shown in Fig.
89. Similar glazing is also employed in the related, obliquely
pierced openings of Zuñi, to be described later.</p>

<p>Selenite, in all probability, was not used in pre-Spanish times. No
examples have as yet been met with among ruins in the region where this
material is found and now used. Throughout the south and east portion of
the ancient pueblo region, explored by Mr. A.&nbsp;F. Bandelier, where
many of the remains were in a very good state of preservation, no cases
of the use of this substance were seen. Fig. 90

<p>In Zuñi some of the kivas are provided with small external windows
framed with slabs of stone. It is likely that the kivas would for a long
time perpetuate methods and practices that had been superseded in the
construction of dwellings. The use of stone jambs, however, would
necessarily be limited to openings of small size, as such use for large
openings was beyond the mechanical skill of the pueblo builders.</p>

Fig. 91 illustrates the manner of making small
openings in external exposed walls in Zuñi. Stone frames occur only
occasionally in what seem to be the older and least modified portions of
the village. At Tusayan, however, this method of framing windows is much
more noticeable, as the exceptional crowding that has exercised such an
influence on Zuñi construction has not occurred there. The Tusayan
houses are arranged more in rows, often with a suggestion of large
inclosures resembling the courts of the ancient pueblos. The inclosures
have not been encroached upon, the streets are wider, and altogether the
earlier methods seem to have been retained in greater purity than in
Zuñi. The unbroken outer wall, of two or three stories in height, like
the same feature of the old villages, is pierced at various heights with
small openings that do not seriously impair its efficiency for defense.
Tusayan examples of these loop-hole-like openings maybe seen in Pls. <a

Openings of this type, not more than 4&nbsp;inches square, pierced the second
story outer wall of the pueblo of Wejegi in the Chaco Canyon. In the
pueblo of Kin-tiel (<a href = "#plateLXIII">Pl. <span class =

skillfully constructed in the outer wall at the rounded northeastern
corner of the pueblo. The openings pierced the wall at an oblique angle,
as shown on the plan. Two of these channel-like loopholes maybe seen in

Plate CVI. Sealed openings in a detached house of Nutria.</p>

<p>It is often the practice in the modern pueblos to seal up the windows
of a house with masonry, and sometimes the doors also during the
temporary absence of the occupant, which absence often takes place at
the seasons of planting and harvesting. At such times many Zuñi families
occupy outlying farming pueblos, such as Nutria and Pescado, and the
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<a name = "page199" id = "page199"> </a>
<!--png 414-->
Tusayans, in a like manner, live in rude summer shelters close to their
fields. Such absence from the home pueblo often lasts for a month or
more at a time. The work of closing the opening is done sometimes in the
roughest manner, but examples are seen in which carefully laid masonry
has been used. The latter is sometimes plastered. Occasionally the
sealing is done with a thin slab of sandstone, somewhat larger than the
opening, held in place with mud plastering, or propped from the inside
after the manner of the “stone close” previously described.
Fig. 92 illustrates specimens of sealed openings in the
village of Hano of the Tusayan group. The upper window is closed with a
single large slab and a few small chinking stones at one side. The
masonry used in closing the lower opening is scarcely distinguishable
from that of the adjoining walls. Pl. <span class

opening in a detached house of Nutria, whose occupants had returned to
the home pueblo of Zuñi at the close of the harvesting season. The
doorway in this case is only partly closed, leaving a window-like
aperture at

<p>Windows and doors closed with masonry are often met with in the
remains of ancient pueblos, suggesting, perhaps, that some of the
occupants were absent at the time of the destruction of the village.
When large door-like openings in upper external walls were built up and
plastered over in this way, as in some ruins, the purpose was to
economize heat during the winter, as blankets or rugs made of skins
would be inadequate.</p>

Plate CVII. Partial filling-in of a large opening in Oraibi, converting
it into a doorway.</p>

<p>Besides the closing and reopening of doors and windows just
described, the modern pueblo builders frequently make permanent changes
in such openings. Doors are often converted into windows, and windows
are reduced in size or enlarged, or new ones are broken through the
walls, apparently, with the greatest freedom, so that they do not, from
their finish or method of construction, furnish any clue to the
antiquity of the mud-covered wall in which they are found. Occasionally
surface weathering of the walls, particularly in Zuñi, exposes a bit of
horizontal pole embedded in the masonry, the lintel of a window long
since sealed up and obliterated by successive coats of mud finish. It is
probable that many openings are so covered up as to leave no trace of
their existence on the external wall. In Zuñi particularly, where the
original arrangement for entering and lighting many of the rooms must
have been wholly lost in the dense clustering of later times, such
changes are very numerous. It often happens that the addition of a new
room will shut off one or more old windows, and in such cases the latter
are often converted into interior niches which serve as open cupboards.
Such niches were sometimes of considerable size in the older pueblos.
Changes in the character of openings are quite common in all of the
pueblos. Usually the evidences of such changes are much clearer in the
rougher and more exposed work of Tusayan than in the adobe-finished
houses of Zuñi. Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CVII</span> illustrates a large, balcony-like opening
in Oraibi that has been reduced to the size of an ordinary door by
filling in with rough masonry. A&nbsp;small window has been left
immediately over the lintel of the newer door. Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">CVIII</span> illustrates two large openings in
this village that have been treated in a somewhat similar manner, but
the filling has been carried farther. Both of these openings have been
used as doorways at one stage of their reduction, the one on the right
having been provided with a small transom; the combined opening was
arranged wholly within the large one and under its transom. In the
further conversion of this doorway into a small window, the secondary
transom was blocked up with stone slabs, set on edge, and a small
loophole window in the upper lefthand corner of the large opening was
also closed. The masonry filling of the large opening on the left in
this illustration shows no trace of a transom over the smaller doorway.
A small loophole in the corner of this large opening is still left open.
It will be noted that the original transoms of the large openings have
in all these cases been entirely filled up with masonry.</p>

<p>The clearness with which all the steps of the gradual reduction of
these openings can be traced in the exposed stone work is in marked
contrast with the obscurity of such features in Zuñi. In the latter
group, however, examples are occasionally seen where a doorway has been
partly closed with masonry, leaving enough space at the top for a
window. Often in such cases the filled-in masonry is thinner than that
of the adjoining wall, and consequently the form of the original doorway
is easily traced. Fig. 93, from an adobe wall in
Zuñi, gives an illustration of this. The entrance doorway of the
detached Zuñi house illustrated in <a href = "#plateLXXXIII">Pl. <span

size, leaving traces of the original form in a slight offset. In modern
times, both in Tusayan and Cibola, changes in the form and disposition
of openings seem to have been made with the greatest freedom, but in the
ancient pueblos altered doors or windows have rarely been found. The
original placing of these features was more carefully considered, and
the buildings were rarely subjected to unforeseen and irregular
crowding.</p>

ROOF OPENINGS.</a></h6>

<p>The line of separation between roof openings and doors and windows
is, with few exceptions, sharply drawn. The origin of these roof-holes,
whose use at the present time is widespread, was undoubtedly in the
simple trap door which gave access to the rooms of the first terrace. <a

Here there is but little difference between the entrance traps of the
ceremonial chambers and those that give access to the rooms of the first
terrace; the former are in most cases somewhat larger to admit of
ingress of costumed dancers,

and the kiva traps are usually on a somewhat sharper slope, conforming
to the pitch of the small dome-roof of the kivas, while those of the
house terraces have the scarcely perceptible fall of the house roofs in
which they are placed. In Zuñi, however, where the development and use
of openings has been carried further, the kiva hatchways are
distinguished by a specialized form that will be described later. An
examination of the plans of the modern villages in <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘Chapter’">Chapters</ins> <span class =
"smallroman">II</span> and <span class = "smallroman">III</span> will
show the general distribution of roof openings. Those used as hatchways
are distinguishable by their greater dimensions, and in many cases by
the presence of the ladders that give access to the rooms below. The
smaller roof openings in their simplest form are constructed in
essentially the same manner as the trap doors, and the width is usually
regulated by the distance between two adjacent roof beams. The second
series of small roof poles is interrupted at the sides of the opening,
which sides are finished by means of carefully laid small stones in the
same manner as are projecting copings. This finish is often carried
several inches above the roof and crowned with narrow stone slabs, one
on each of the four sides, forming a sort of frame which protects the
mud plastered sides of the opening from the action of the rains.
Examples of this simple type may be seen in many of the figures
illustrating Chapters <span class = "smallroman">II</span> and <span
class = "smallroman">III</span>, and in <a href = "#plateXCVII">Pl.

of the examples in this figure are
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>

of openings that give access to lower rooms. Occasional instances are
seen in this pueblo in which an exaggerated height is given to the
coping, the result slightly approaching a square chimney in effect. <a
href = "#fig95">Fig. 95</a> illustrates an example of this form.</p>

<p>In Zuñi, where many minor variations in the forms of roof openings
occur, certain of these variations appear to be related to roof
drainage. These have three sides crowned in the usual manner with coping
stones laid flat, but the fourth side is formed by setting a thin slab
on edge, as illustrated in <a href = "#fig96">Fig.&nbsp;96</a>.</p>

The special object of this arrangement is in some cases difficult to
determine; the raised end in all the examples on any one roof always
takes the same direction, and in many cases its position relative to
drainage suggests that it is a provision against flooding by rain on the
slightly sloping roof; but this relation to drainage is by no means
constant. Roof holes on the west side of the village in such positions
as to be directly exposed to the violent sand storms that prevail here
during certain months of the year seem in some cases to have in view
protection against the flying sand. We do not meet with evidence of any
fixed system to guide the disposition of this feature. In many cases
these trap holes are provided with a thin slab of sandstone large enough
to cover the whole opening, and used in times of rain. During fair
weather these are laid on the roof, near the hole they are designed to
cover, or lie tilted against the higher edge of the trap, as shown in <a
href = "#fig97">Fig.&nbsp;97</a>.</p>

<p>When the cover is placed on one of these holes, with a high slab at
one end, it has a steep pitch, to shed water, and at the same time light
and air are to some extent admitted, but it is very doubtful if this is
the result of direct intention on the part of the builder. The possible
development of this roof trap of unusual elevation into a rudimentary
chimney has already been mentioned in the discussion of chimneys. A
development in this direction would possibly be suggested by the
desirability of separating the access by ladder from the inconvenient
smoke hole. This must have been brought very forcibly to the attention
of the Indian when, at the time a fire was burning in the fireplace,
they were compelled to descend the ladder amidst the smoke and heat.</p>

<!--png 426-->
<p>The survival to the present time of such an inconvenient arrangement
in the kivas can be explained only on the ground of the intense
conservatism of these people in all that pertains to religion. In the
small roof holes methods of construction are seen which would not be so
practicable on the larger scale of the ladder holes after which they
have been modeled. In these latter the sides are built up of masonry or
adobe, but the framing around them is more like the usual coping over
walls. The stone that, set on edge in the small openings built for the
admission of light, forms a raised end never occurs in these. The ladder
for access rests against the coping.</p>

<p>When occurring in connection with kivas, ladder holes have certain
peculiarities in which they differ from the ordinary form used in
dwellings. The opening in such cases is made of large size to admit
dancers in costume with full paraphernalia. These, the largest roof
openings to be found in Zuñi, are framed with pieces of wood. The
methods of holding the pieces in place vary somewhat in minor detail. It
is quite likely that recent examples, while still preserving the form
and general appearance of the earlier ones, would bear evidence that the
builders had used their knowledge of improved methods of joining and
finishing.</p>

Kiva trapdoor in Zuñi.</p>

<p>As may readily be seen from the illustration, Fig.
98, this framing, by the addition of a cross piece, divides the
opening unequally. The smaller aperture is situated immediately above
the fireplace (which conforms to the ancient type without chimney and
located in the open floor of the room) and is very evidently designed to
furnish an outlet to the smoke. In a chamber having no side doors or
windows, or at most
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
<!--png 427-->
very small square windows, and consequently no drafts, the column of
smoke and flame can often on still nights be seen rising vertically from
the roof. The other portion of the opening containing the ladder is used
for ingress and egress. This singular combination strongly suggests that
at no very remote period one opening was used to answer both purposes,
as it still does in the Tusayan kivas. It also suggests the direction in
which differentiation of functions began to take place, which in the
kiva was delayed and held back by the conservative religious feeling,
when in the civil architecture it may have been the initial point of a
development that culminated in the chimney, a&nbsp;development that was
assisted in its later steps by suggestions from foreign sources. In the
more primitively constructed examples the cross pieces seem to be simply
laid on without any cutting in. The central piece is held in place by a
peg set into each side piece, the weight and thrust of the ladder
helping to hold it. The primitive arrangement here seen has been
somewhat improved upon in some other cases, but it was not ascertained
whether these were of later date or not.</p>

<p>In the best made frames for kiva entrances the timbers are “halved”
in the manner of our carpenters, the joint being additionally secured by
a pin as shown in Fig.&nbsp;99.</p>

<p>The use of a frame of wood in these trapdoors dates back to a
comparatively high antiquity, and is not at all a modern innovation, as
one would at first be inclined to believe. Their use in so highly
developed a form in the ceremonial chamber is an argument in favor of
antiquity. Only two examples were discovered by Mr. L.&nbsp;H. Morgan in
a ruined pueblo on the Animas. “One of these measured 16 by 17 inches
and the other was 16 inches square. Each was formed in the floor by
pieces of wood put together. The work was neatly done.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Morgan does not describe in detail the manner in
which the joining was effected, or whether the pieces were halved or cut
to fit. It seems hardly likely, considering the rude facilities
possessed by the ancients, that the enormous labor of reducing large
pieces of wood to such interfitting shapes would have been undertaken. A
certain neatness of finish would undoubtedly be attained by arranging
the principal roof beams and the small poles that cross them at right
angles, in the usual careful manner of the ancient builders. The kiva
roof opening, with the hole serving for access and smoke exit, is
paralleled
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
<!--png 430-->
in the excavated lodges of the San Francisco Mountains, where a single
opening served this double purpose. A&nbsp;slight recess or excavation
in the side of the entrance shaft evidently served for the exit of smoke.</p>

<p>At the village of Acoma the kiva trapdoors differ somewhat from the
Zuñi form. The survey of this village was somewhat hasty, and no
opportunity was afforded of ascertaining from the Indians the special
purpose of the mode of construction adopted. The roof hole is divided,
as in Zuñi, but the portion against which the ladder leans, instead of
being made into a smoke vent, is provided with a small roof. These roof
holes to the ceremonial chamber are entered directly from the open air,
while in the dwelling rooms it seems customary (much more customary than
at Zuñi) to enter the lower stories through trapdoors within upper
rooms. In many instances second-story rooms have no exterior rooms but
are entered from rooms above, contrary to the usual arrangement in both
Tusayan and Cibola. All six of the kivas in this village are provided
with this peculiarly constructed opening.</p>

<p>In Zuñi close crowding of the cells has led to an exceptionally
frequent use of roof-lights and trapdoors. The ingenuity of the builders
was greatly taxed to admit sufficient light to the inner rooms. The roof
hole, which was originally used only to furnish the means of access and
light for the first terrace, as is still the case in Tusayan, is here
used in all stories indiscriminately, and principally for light and air.
In large clusters there are necessarily many dark rooms, which has led
to the employment of great numbers of roof holes, more or less directly
modeled after the ordinary trapdoor. Their occurrence is particularly
frequent in the larger clusters of the village, as in house No.&nbsp;1. The
exceptional size of this pile, and of the adjoining house No.&nbsp;4, with
the consequent large proportion of dark rooms, have taxed the ingenuity
of the Zuñi to the utmost, and as a result we see roof openings here
assuming a degree of importance not found elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to roof openings of the type described, the dense
clustering of the Zuñi houses has led to the invention of a curious
device for lighting inner rooms not reached by ordinary external
openings. This consists of an opening, usually of oval or subrectangular
form in elevation, placed at the junction of the roof with a vertical
wall. This opening is carried down obliquely between the roofing beams,
as shown in the sections, Fig. 100, so that the
light is admitted within the room just at the junction of the ceiling
and the inner face of the wall. With the meager facilities and rude
methods of the Zuñi, this peculiar arrangement often involved weak
construction, and the openings, placed so low in the wall, were in
danger of admitting water from the roof. The difficulty of obtaining the
desired light by this device was much lessened where the outer roof was
somewhat lower than the ceiling within.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">208</span>

These oblique openings occur not only in the larger clusters of houses
Nos. 1 and&nbsp;4, but also in the more openly planned portions of the
village, though they do not occur either at Acoma or in the Tusayan
villages. They afford an interesting example of the transfer and
continuance in use of a constructional device developed in one place by
unusual conditions to a new field in which it was uncalled for, being
less efficient and more difficult of introduction than the devices in
ordinary use.</p>

<p>The pueblo Indian has little household furniture, in the sense in
which the term is commonly employed; but his home contains certain
features which are more or less closely embodied in the house
construction and which answers the purpose. The suspended pole that
serves as a clothes rack for ordinary wearing apparel, extra blankets,
robes, etc., has already been described in treating of interiors.
Religious costumes and ceremonial paraphernalia are more carefully
provided for, and are stored away in some hidden corner of the dark
storerooms.</p>

<p>The small wall niches, which are formed by closing a window with a
thin filling-in wall, and which answer the purpose of cupboards or
receptacles

<p>In many houses, both in Tusayan and in Cibola, shelves are
constructed for the more convenient storage of food, etc. These are
often constructed in a very primitive manner, particularly in the former
province. An unusually frail example may be seen in <a href =
"#fig67">Fig. 67</a>, in connection with a fireplace.
Fig. 101, showing a series of mealing stones in a Tusayan
house, also illustrates a rude shelf in the corner of the room,
supported at one end by an upright stone slab and at the other by a
projecting wooden peg. Shelves made of sawed boards are occasionally
seen, but as a rule such boards are considered too valuable to be used
in this manner. A&nbsp;more common arrangement, particularly in Tusayan,
is a combination of three or four slender poles placed side by side,
2&nbsp;or 3 inches apart, forming a rude shelf, upon which trays of
food are kept.</p>

<p>A curious modification of this device was seen in one of the inner
rooms in Zuñi, in the house of José Pié. A&nbsp;large earthen jar, apparently
an ordinary water vessel, was built into a projecting masonry bench near
the corner of the room in such a manner that its rim projected less than
half an inch above its surface. This jar was used for the same purpose
as the Tusayan corner bin.</p>

precious ceremonial articles, such as feathers and beads. This is an

<p>Perhaps the most important article of furniture in the home of the
pueblo Indian is the mealing trough, containing the household milling
apparatus. This trough usually contains a series of three metates of
varying degrees of coarseness firmly fixed in a slanting position most
convenient for the workers. It consists of thin slabs of sandstone set
into the floor on edge, similar slabs forming the separating partitions
between the compartments. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 105,
illustrating a Tusayan mealing trough. Those of
Zuñi are of the same form, as maybe seen in the illustration of a Zuñi
interior, Fig. 105. Occasionally in recently
constructed specimens the thin inclosing walls of the trough are made of
planks. In the example illustrated one end of the series is bounded by a
board, all the other walls and divisions being made of the usual stone
slabs. The metates themselves are not usually more than 3&nbsp;inches in
thickness. They are so adjusted in their setting of stones and mortar as
to slope away from the operator at the proper angle. This arrangement of
the mealing stones is characteristic of the more densely clustered
communal houses of late date. In the more primitive house the mealing
stone was usually a single large piece of cellular basalt, or similar
rock, in which a broad, sloping depression was carved, and which could
be transported from place to place. Fig. 106
illustrates an example of this type from the vicinity of Globe, in
southern Arizona. The stationary mealing trough of the present day is
undoubtedly the successor of the earner moveable form, yet it was in use
among the pueblos at the time of the first Spanish expedition, as the
following extract from Castañeda’s account<a class = "tag" name = "tag9"
id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> of Cibola will show. He says a special
room is designed to grind the grain: “This last is apart, and contains a
furnace and three stones made fast in {no para} masonry.
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
<!--png 439-->
Three women sit down before these stones; the first crushes the grain,
the second brays it, and the third reduces it entirely to powder.” It
will be seen how exactly this description fits both the arrangement and
the use of this mill at the present time. The perfection of mechanical
devices and the refinement of methods here exhibited would seem to be in
advance of the achievement of this people in other directions.</p>

<p>The grinding stones of the mealing apparatus are of correspondingly
varying degrees of roughness; those of basalt or lava are used for the
first crushing of the corn, and sandstone is used for the final grinding
on the last metate of the series. By means of these primitive appliances
the corn meal is as finely ground as our wheaten flour. The grinding
stones now used are always flat, as shown in Fig.
105, and differ from those that were used with the early massive
type of metate in being of cylindrical form.</p>

<p>One end of the series of milling troughs is usually built against the
wall near the corner of the room. In some cases, where the room is quite
narrow, the series extends across from wall to wall. Series comprising
four mealing stones, sometimes seen in Zuñi, are very generally arranged
in this manner. In all cases sufficient floor space is left behind the
mills to accommodate the women who kneel at their work. <a href =

illustrates an unusual arrangement, in which the fourth mealing stone is
set at right angles to the other stones of the series.</p>

<p>Mortars are in general use in Zuñi and Tusayan households. As a rule
they are of considerable size, and made of the same material as the
rougher mealing stones. They are employed for crushing and grinding the
chile or red pepper that enters so largely into the food of the Zuñi,
and whose use has extended to the Mexicans of the same region. These
mortars have the ordinary circular depressions and are used with a round
pestle or crusher, often of somewhat long, cylindrical form for
convenience in handling.</p>

<p>Parts of the apparatus for indoor blanket weaving seen in some of the
pueblo houses may be included under the heading of furniture. These
consist of devices for the attachment of the movable parts of the loom,
which need not be described in this connection. In some of the Tusayan
houses may be seen examples of posts sunk in the floor provided with
holes for the insertion of cords for attaching and tightening the warp,
similar to those built into the kiva floors, illustrated in <a href =
"#fig31">Fig. 31</a>. No device of this kind was seen in Zuñi. A&nbsp;more
primitive appliance for such work is seen in both groups of pueblos in
an occasional stump of a beam or short pole projecting from the wall at
varying heights. Ceiling beams are also used for stretching the warp
both in blanket and belt weaving.</p>

<p>The furnishings of a pueblo house do not include tables and chairs.
The meals are eaten directly from the stone-paved floor, the
participants rarely having any other seat than the blanket that they
wear, rolled up or folded into convenient form. Small stools are
sometimes seen, but

<!--png 442-->
the need of such appliances does not seem to be keenly felt by these
Indians, who can, for hours, sit in a peculiar squatting position on
their haunches, without any apparent discomfort. Though moveable chairs
or stools are rare, nearly all of the dwellings are provided with the
low ledge or bench around the rooms, which in earlier times seems to
have been confined to the kivas. A&nbsp;slight advance on this fixed form of
seat was the stone block used in the Tusayan kivas, described on <a href
= "#page132">p.&nbsp;132</a>, which at the same time served a useful
purpose in the adjustment of the warp threads for blanket weaving.</p>

<p>The few wooden stools observed show very primitive workmanship, and
are usually made of a single piece of wood. Fig.
107 illustrates two forms of wooden stool from Zuñi. The small
three-legged stool on the left has been cut from the trunk of a piñon
tree in such a manner as to utilize as legs the three branches into
which the main stem separated. The other stool illustrated is also cut
from a single piece of tree trunk, which has been reduced in weight by
cutting out one side, leaving the two ends for support.</p>

<p>A curiously worked chair of modern form seen in Zuñi is illustrated
in Fig. 108. It was difficult to determine the
antiquity of this specimen, as its rickety condition may have been due
to the clumsy workmanship quite as much as to the effects of age. Rude
as is the workmanship, however, it was far beyond the unaided skill of
the native craftsman to join and mortise the various pieces that go to
make up this chair. Some decorative effect has been sought here, the
ornamentation, made up of notches and sunken grooves, closely resembling
that on the window sash illustrated in <a href = "#fig88">Fig. 88</a>,
and somewhat <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘similiar’">similar</ins>
in effect to the carving on the Spanish beams
seen in the Tusayan kivas. The whole construction strongly suggests
Spanish influence.</p>

Even the influence of Americans has as yet failed to bring about the use
of tables or bedsteads among the pueblo Indians. The floor answers all
the purposes of both these useful articles of furniture. The food dishes
are placed directly upon it at meal times, and at night the blankets,
rugs, and sheep skins that form the bed are spread directly upon it.
These latter, during the day, are suspended upon the clothes pole
previously described and illustrated.</p>

CORRALS AND GARDENS.</a></h6>

<p>The introduction of domestic sheep among the pueblos has added a new
and important element to their mode of living, but they seem never to
have reached a clear understanding as to how these animals should be
cared for. No forethought is exercised to separate the rams so that the
lambs will be born at a favorable season. The flocks consist of sheep
and goats which are allowed to run together at all tunes. Black sheep
and some with a grayish color of wool are often seen among them. No
attempt is made to eliminate these dark-fleeced members of the flock,
since the black and gray wool is utilized in its natural color in
producing many of the designs and patterns of the blankets woven by
these people. The flocks are usually driven up into the corrals or
inclosures every evening, and are taken out again in the morning,
frequently at quite a late hour. This, together with the time consumed
in driving them to and from pasture, gives them much less chance to
thrive than those of the nomadic Navajo. In Tusayan the corrals are
usually of small size and inclosed by thin walls of rude stone work.
This may be seen in the foreground of <a href = "#plateXXI">Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">XXI</span></a>. Pl. <span
class = "smallroman">CIX</span> illustrates several corrals just
outside the village of Mashongnavi similarly constructed, but of
somewhat larger size. Some of the corrals of Oraibi are of still larger
size, approaching in this respect the corrals of Cibola. The Oraibi pens
are rudely rectangular in form, with more or less rounded angles, and
are also built of rude masonry.</p>

<p>In the less important villages of Cibola stone is occasionally used
for inclosing the corrals, as in Tusayan, as may be seen in <a href =
"#plateLXX">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXX</span></a>, illustrating
an inclosure of this character in the court of the farming pueblo of
Pescado. Pl. <span class =
"smallroman">CX</span> illustrates in detail the manner in which
stone work is combined with the use of rude stakes in the construction
of this inclosure. On the rugged sites of the Tusayan villages corrals
are placed wherever favorable nooks happen to be found in the rocks, but
at Zuñi, built in the comparatively open plain, they form a nearly
continuous belt around the pueblo. Here they are made of stakes and
brush held in place by horizontal poles tied on with strips of rawhide.
The rudely contrived gateways are supported in natural forks at the top
and sides of posts. Often one or two small inclosures used for burros or
horses occur near these sheep corrals. The construction is identical
with those above described and is very rude. It is illustrated in <a
href = "#fig109">Fig. 109</a>, which shows the manner in which the
stakes are arranged, and also
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
<!--png 446-->
the method of attaching the horizontal tie-pieces. The construction of
these inclosures is frail, and the danger of pushing the stakes over by
pressure from within is guarded against by employing forked braces that
abut against horizontal pieces tied on 4&nbsp;or 5 feet from the ground.

Construction of a Zuñi corral.</p>

<p>In both of the pueblo groups under discussion, small gardens
contiguous to the villages are frequent. Those of Tusayan are walled in
with stone.</p>

<p>Within the pueblo of Zuñi a small group of garden patches is inclosed
by stake fences, but the majority of the gardens in the vicinity of the
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
<!--png 447-->
principal villages are provided with low walls of mud masonry. The small
terraced gardens here are near the river bank on the southwest and
southeast sides of the village. The inclosed spaces, averaging in size
about 10 feet square, are used for the cultivation of red peppers,
beans, etc., which, during the dry season, are watered by hand. These
inclosures, situated close to the dwellings, suggest a probable
explanation for similar inclosures found in many of the ruins in the
southern and eastern portions of the ancient pueblo region. Mr.
Bandelier was informed by the Pimas<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id =
"tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> that these inclosures were ancient
gardens. He concluded that since acequias were frequent in the immediate
vicinity these gardens must have been used as reserves in case of war,
when the larger fields were not available, but the manner of their
occurrence in Zuñi suggests rather that they were intended for
cultivation of special crops, such as pepper, beans, cotton, and perhaps
also of a variety of
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
<!--png 450-->
tobacco&mdash;corn, melons, squashes, etc., being cultivated elsewhere
in larger tracts. There is a large group of gardens on the bank of the
stream at the southeastern corner of Zuñi, and here there are slight
indications of terracing. A&nbsp;second group on the steeper slope at the
southwestern corner is distinctly terraced. Small walled gardens of the
same type as these Zuñi examples occur in the vicinity of some of the
Tusayan villages on the middle mesa. They are located near the springs
or water pockets, apparently to facilitate watering by hand. Some of
them contain a few small peach trees in addition to the vegetable crops
ordinarily met with. The clusters here are, as a rule, smaller than
those of Zuñi, as there is much less space available in the vicinity of
the springs. At one point on the west side of the first mesa, a&nbsp;few
miles above Walpi, a&nbsp;copious spring serves to irrigate quite an
extensive series of small garden patches distributed over lower
slopes.</p>

<p>At several points around Zuñi, usually at a greater distance than the
terrace gardens, are fields of much larger area inclosed in a similar
manner. Their inclosure was simply to secure them against the
depredations of stray burros, so numerous about the village. When the
crops are gathered in the autumn, several breaches are made in the low
wall and the burros are allowed to luxuriate on the remains. <a href =

“KISI” CONSTRUCTION.</a></h6>

<p>Lightly constructed shelters for the use of those in charge of fields
were probably a constant accompaniment of pueblo horticulture. Such
shelters were built of stone or of brush, according to which material
was most available.</p>

<p>In very precipitous localities, as the Canyon de Chelly, these
outlooks naturally became the so-called cliff-dwellings or isolated
shelters. In Cibola single stone houses are in common use, not to the
exclusion, however, of the lighter structures of brush, while in Tusayan
these lighter forms, of which there are a number of well defined
varieties, are almost exclusively used. A&nbsp;detailed study of the methods
of construction employed in these rude shelters would be of great
interest as affording a comparison both with the building methods of the
ruder neighboring tribes and with those adopted in constructing some of
the details of the terraced house; the writer, however, did not have an
opportunity of making an examination of all the field shelters used in
these pueblos. Two of the simpler types are the “tuwahlki,” or watch
house, and the “kishoni,” or uncovered shade. The former is constructed
by first
<span class = "pagenum">218</span>

planting a short forked stick in the ground, which supports one end of a
pole, the other end resting on the ground. The interval between this
ridge pole and the ground is roughly filled in with slanting sticks and
brush, the inclosed space being not more than 3&nbsp;feet in height, with a
maximum width of four or five feet. These shelters are for the
accommodation of the children who watch the melon patches until the
fruit is harvested.</p>

Kishoni, or uncovered shade, of Tusayan.</p>

<p>The kishoni, or uncovered shade, illustrated in Fig. 111,
is perhaps the simplest form of shelter
employed. Ten or a dozen cottonwood saplings are set firmly into the
ground, so as to form a slightly curved inclosure with convex side
toward the south. Cottonwood and willow boughs in foliage, grease-wood,
sage brush, and rabbit brush are laid with stems upward in even rows
against these saplings to a height of 6&nbsp;or 7 feet. This light material
is held in place by bands of small cottonwood branches laid in
continuous horizontal lines around the outside of the shelter and these
are attached to the upright saplings with cottonwood and willow
twigs.</p>

CONCLUDING REMARKS.</a></h4>


<p>The modern villages of Tusayan and Cibola differ more widely in
arrangement and in the relation they bear to the surrounding topography
than did their predecessors even of historic times.</p>

<p>Many of the older pueblos of both groups appear to have belonged to
the valley types&mdash;villages of considerable size, located in open
plains or on the slopes of low-lying foothills. A&nbsp;comparison of the
plans in Chapters <span class = "smallroman">II</span> and <span class =
"smallroman">III</span> will illustrate these differences. In Tusayan
the necessity of defense has driven the builders to inaccessible sites,
so that now all the occupied villages of the province are found on mesa
summits. The inhabitants of the valley pueblos of Cibola, although
compelled at one time to build their houses upon the almost inaccessible
summit of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Tâaiyalana’">Tâaaiyalana</ins> mesa,
occupied this site only
temporarily, and soon established a large valley pueblo, the size and
large population of which afforded that defensive efficiency which the
Tusayan obtained only by building on mesa promontories. This has
resulted in some adherence on the part of the Tusayan to the village
plans of their ancestors, while at Zuni the great house clusters,
forming the largest pueblo occupied in modern times, show a wide
departure from the primitive types. In both provinces the architecture
is distinguished from that of other portions of the pueblo region by
greater irregularity of
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>

<!--png 463-->
plan and by less skillfully executed constructional details; each group,
however, happens to contain a notable exception to this general
carelessness.</p>

<p>In Cibola the pueblo of Kin-tiel, built with a continuous defensive
outer wall, occupies architecturally a somewhat anomalous position,
notwithstanding its traditional connection with the group, and the Fire
House occupies much the same relation in reference to Tusayan. The
latter, however, does not break in upon the unity of the group, since
the Tusayan, to a much greater extent than the Zuñi, are made up of
remnants of various bands of builders. In Cibola, however, some of the
Indians state that their ancestors, before reaching Zuñi, built a number
of pueblos, whose ruins are distinguished from those illustrated in the
present paper by the presence of circular kivas, this form of ceremonial
room being, apparently, wholly absent from the Cibolan pueblos here
discussed.</p>

<p>The people of Cibola and of Tusayan belong to distinct linguistic
stocks, but their arts are very closely related, the differences being
no greater than would result from the slightly different conditions that
have operated within the last few generations. Zuñi, perhaps, came more
directly under early Spanish influence than Tusayan.</p>

<p>Churches were established, as has been seen, in both provinces, but
it is doubtful whether their presence produced any lasting impression on
the people. In Tusayan the sway of the Spaniards was very brief. At some
of the pueblos the churches seem to have been built outside of the
village proper where ample space was available within the pueblo; but
such an encroachment on the original inclosed courts seems never to have
been attempted. Zuñi is an apparent exception; but all the house
clusters east of the church have probably been built later than the
church itself, the church court of the present village being a much
larger area than would be reserved for the usual pueblo court. These
early churches were, as a rule, built of adobe, even when occurring in
stone pueblos. The only exception noticed is at Ketchipauan, where it
was built of the characteristic Indian smoothly chinked masonry. The
Spaniards usually intruded their own construction, even to the
composition of the bricks, which are nearly always made of straw
adobe.</p>

<p>At Tusayan there is no evidence that a church or mission house ever
formed part of the villages on the mesa summits. Their plans are
complete in themselves, and probably represent closely the first pueblos
built on these sites. These summits have been extensively occupied only
in comparatively recent times, although one or more small clusters may
have been built here at an early date as outlooks over the fields in the
valleys below.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that some of the ruins connected traditionally and
historically with Tusayan and Cibola differ in no particular from stone
pueblos widely scattered over the southwestern plateaus which have been
from time to time invested with a halo of romantic antiquity, and

<!--png 466-->
regarded as remarkable achievements in civilization by a vanished but
once powerful race. These deserted stone houses, occurring in the midst
of desert solitudes, appealed strongly to the imaginations of early
explorers, and their stimulated fancy connected the remains with
“Aztecs” and other mysterious peoples. That this early implanted bias
has caused the invention of many ingenious theories concerning the
origin and disappearance of the builders of the ancient pueblos, is
amply attested in the conclusions reached by many of the writers on this
subject.</p>

<p>In connection with the architectural examination of some of these
remains many traditions have been obtained from the present tribes,
clearly indicating that some of the village ruins, and even cliff
dwellings, have been built and occupied by ancestors of the present
Pueblo Indians, sometimes at a date well within the historic period.</p>

<p>The migrations of the Tusayan clans, as described in the legends
collected by Mr. Stephen, were slow and tedious. While they pursued
their wanderings and awaited the favorable omens of the gods they halted
many times and planted. They speak traditionally of stopping at certain
places on their routes during a certain number of “plantings,” always
building the characteristic stone pueblos and then again taking up the
march.</p>

<p>When these Indians are questioned as to whence they came, their
replies are various and conflicting; but this is due to the fact that
the members of one clan came, after a long series of wanderings, from
the north, for instance, while those of other gentes may have come last
from the east. The tribe to-day seems to be made up of a collection or a
confederacy of many enfeebled remnants of independent phratries and
groups once more numerous and powerful. Some clans traditionally
referred to as having been important are now represented by few
survivors, and bid fair soon to become extinct. So the members of each
phratry have their own store of traditions, relating to the wanderings
of their own ancestors, which differ from those of other clans, and
refer to villages successively built and occupied by them. In the case
of others of the pueblos, the occupation of cliff dwellings and cave
lodges is known to have occurred within historic times.</p>

<p>Both architectural and traditional evidence are in accord in
establishing a continuity of descent from the ancient Pueblos to those
of the present day. Many of the communities are now made up of the more
or less scattered but interrelated remnants of gentes which in former
times occupied villages, the remains of which are to-day looked upon as
the early homes of “Aztec colonies,” etc.</p>

<p>The adaptation, of this architecture to the peculiar environment
indicates that it has long been practiced under the same conditions that
now prevail. Nearly all of the ancient pueblos were built of the
sandstone found in natural quarries at the bases of hundreds of cliffs
throughout these table-lands. This stone readily breaks into small
pieces of regular
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
<!--png 467-->
form, suitable for use in the simple masonry of the pueblos without
receiving any artificial treatment. The walls themselves give an
exaggerated idea of finish, owing to the care and neatness with which
the component stones are placed. Some of the illustrations in the last
chapter, from photographs, show clearly that the material of the walls
was much ruder than the appearance of the finished masonry would
suggest, and that this finish depended on the careful selection and
arrangement of the fragments. This is even more noticeable in the Chaco
ruins, in which the walls were wrought to a high degrees of surface
finish. The core of the wall was laid up with the larger and more
irregular stones, and was afterwards brought to a smooth face by
carefully filling in and chinking the joints with smaller stones and
fragments, sometimes not more than a quarter of an inch thick; this
method is still roughly followed by both Tusayan and Cibolan
builders.</p>

<p>Although many details of construction and arrangement display
remarkable adaptation to the physical character of the country, yet the
influence of such environment would not alone suffice to produce this
architectural type. In order to develop the results found, another
element was necessary. This element was the necessity for defense. The
pueblo population was probably subjected to the more or less continuous
influence of this defensive motive throughout the period of their
occupation of this territory. A&nbsp;strong independent race of people, who
had to fear no invasion by stronger foes, would necessarily have been
influenced more by the physical environment and would have progressed
further in the art of building, but the motive for building rectangular
rooms&mdash;the initial point of departure in the development of pueblo
architecture&mdash;would not have been brought into action. The crowding
of many habitations upon a small cliff ledge or other restricted site,
resulting in the rectangular form of rooms, was most likely due to the
conditions imposed by this necessity for defense.</p>

<p>The general outlines of the development of this architecture wherein
the ancient builders were stimulated to the best use of the exceptional
materials about them, both by the difficult conditions of their
semi-desert environment and by constant necessity for protection against
their neighbors, can be traced in its various stages of growth from the
primitive conical lodge to its culmination in the large communal village
of many-storied terraced buildings which we find to have been in use at
the time of the Spanish discovery, and which still survives in Zuñi,
perhaps its most striking modern example. Yet the various steps have
resulted from a simple and direct use of the material immediately at
hand, while methods gradually improved as frequent experiments taught
the builders more fully to utilize local facilities. In all cases the
material was derived from the nearest available source, and often
variations in the quality of the finished work are due to variations in
the quality of the stone near by. The results accomplished attest the
patient and persistent industry of the ancient builders, but the work
does not display great skill in construction or in preparation of
material.
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227" id = "page227"> </a>
<!--png 470-->
The same desert environment that furnished such an abundance of material
for the ancient builders, also, from its difficult and inhospitable
character and the constant variations in the water supply, compelled the
frequent employment of this material. This was an important factor in
bringing about the attained degree of advancement in the building art.
At the present day constant local changes occur in the water sources of
these arid table-lands, while the general character of the climate
remains unaltered.</p>

<p>The distinguishing characteristics of Pueblo architecture may be
regarded as the product of a defensive motive and of an arid environment
that furnished an abundance of suitable building material, and at the
same time the climatic conditions that compelled its frequent
employment.</p>

<p>The decline of the defensive motive within the last few years has
greatly affected the more recent architecture. Even after the long
practice of the system has rendered it somewhat fixed, comparative
security from attack has caused many of the Pueblo Indians to recognize
the inconvenience of dwellings grouped in large clusters on sites
difficult of access, while the sources of their subsistence are
necessarily sparsely scattered over large areas. This is noticeable in
the building of small, detached houses at a distance from the main
villages, the greater convenience to crops, flocks and water outweighing
the defensive motive. In Cibola particularly, a&nbsp;marked tendency in this
direction has shown itself within a score of years; Ojo Caliente, the
newest of the farming pueblos, is perhaps the most striking example
within the two provinces. The greater security of the pueblos as the
country comes more fully into the hands of Americans, has also resulted
in the more careless construction in modern examples as compared with
the ancient.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, as time shall go on, the system of building
many-storied clusters of rectangular rooms will gradually be abandoned
by these people. In the absence of the defensive motive a more
convenient system, employing scattered small houses, located near
springs and fields, will gradually take its place, thus returning to a
mode of building that probably prevailed in the evolution of the pueblo
prior to the clustering of many rooms into large defensive villages. <a
href = "#plateLXXXIII">Pl. <span class = "smallroman">LXXXIII</span></a>
illustrates a building of the type described located on the outskirts of
Zuñi, across the river from the main pueblo.</p>

<p>The cultural distinctions between the Pueblo Indians and neighboring
tribes gradually become less clearly defined as investigation
progresses. Mr. Cushing’s study of the Zuñi social, political, and
religious systems has clearly established their essential identity in
grade of culture with those of other tribes. In many of the arts, too,
such as weaving, ceramics, etc., these people in no degree surpass many
tribes who build ruder dwellings.</p>

<!--png 471-->
In architecture, though, they have progressed far beyond their
neighbors; many of the devices employed attest the essentially primitive
character of the art, and demonstrate that the apparent distinction in
grade of culture is mainly due to the exceptional condition of the
environment.</p>

Transcriber’s Notes on the Illustrations</a></h4>

<p>Bureau of Ethnology articles rarely included artist credits, but some
of the drawings are signed:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "../images/signatures.gif" width = "308" height = "189"
alt = "artist’s signatures"
title = "artist’s signatures">
</p>

<p>Henry Hobart Nichols (1869-1962) was one of the Smithsonian’s stable
of artists. These drawings would have been some of his earliest work.
The “fil.” in one signature distinguishes him from his father, the
engraver H.&nbsp;Hobart Nichols (1838-1886), whose signature also
appears in at least one Bureau of Ethnology publication.</p>
