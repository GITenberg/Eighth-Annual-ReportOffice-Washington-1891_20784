<p>The two “Accompanying Papers” that make up the bulk of this book are
also available as individual texts from Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
Victor Mindeleff, <i>A Study of Pueblo Architecture, Tusayan and
Cibola</i>: <a href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19856"
target = "_blank">e-text 19856</a>.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
James Stevenson, <i>The Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand
Painting of the Navajo Indians</i>:
<a href = "http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19331"
target = "_blank">e-text 19331</a>.</p>

<p>The files are identical except that in the present text a few more
typographical errors have been corrected, and some illustrations have
been replaced.</p>

<p>A few words in these two papers use some uncommon letters:</p>

<p class = "inset">ā, ē (vowel with macron or “long” mark)<br>
Ĕ, ĭ, ŏ (vowel with breve or “short” mark)<br>
ⁿ (small raised n).</p>

<p>These words include alternate transcriptions as mouse-hover popups:
<ins class = "translit" title = "Tan[-a]’shkiji">Tanā’shkiji</ins>.
Errors are <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘similiarly’">similarly</ins> marked. The “cents” sign ¢
has been used in place of the rare symbols Ȼ and ȼ.</p>

<p>If the apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as
garbage, you may need to change your browser’s “file encoding” or
“character set” to utf-8 (unicode), or change your browser’s default
font.</p>

<p>All brackets and parenthetical question marks are in the original.
The cover picture is conjectural; it was used in Annual Reports 7, 9 and
others.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>

<p>The prosecution of research among the North American Indians, as
directed by act of Congress, was continued during the fiscal year
1886-’87.</p>

<p>The general plan upon which the work has been prosecuted has been
explained in former reports and has not been changed. After certain
lines of investigation had been decided upon, they were confided to
persons trained in their pursuit, with the intention that the results of
their labors, when completed or well advanced, should be presented from
time to time in the publications of the Bureau provided for by law.
A&nbsp;brief statement of the work upon which each one of the special
students was actively engaged during the fiscal year is furnished below,
but this statement does not embrace all the studies undertaken or
services rendered by them, since particular lines of research have been
suspended in this, as in former years, in order to prosecute unto
substantial completeness work regarded as of paramount importance. From
this cause delays have been occasioned in the completion of several
treatises and monographs, already partly in type, which otherwise would
have been published.</p>

<p>Invitation is renewed for the assistance of explorers, writers, and
students who are not and may not desire to be officially connected with
the Bureau. Their contributions, whether in
<span class = "pagenum roman">XVIII</span>
<a name = "pageXVIII" id = "pageXVIII"> </a>
<!--png 020-->
the shape of suggestions or of extended communications, will be
gratefully acknowledged, and will always receive proper credit if
published either in the series of reports or in monographs or bulletins,
as the liberality of Congress may in future allow.</p>

<p>The items now reported upon are presented in three principal
divisions. The first relates to the publication made; the second, to the
work prosecuted in the field; and the third, to the office work, which
largely consists of the preparation for publication of the results of
field work, with the corrections and additions obtained from the
literature relating to the subjects discussed and by correspondence.</p>


<h5><a name = "intro_pub" id = "intro_pub">
PUBLICATION.</a></h5>

<p>The only publication actually issued during the year was the Fourth
Animal Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Smithsonian Institution,
1882-’83. It is an imperial octavo volume of lxiii + 532 pages,
illustrated by 83 plates, of which 11 are colored, and 564 figures in
the text. The official report of the Director, occupying 39 pages (pp.
xxv-lxiii), is accompanied by the following papers:</p>

<p>Pictographs of the North American Indians, a&nbsp;preliminary paper,
by Garrick Mallery; pp. 3-256, Pls. I-LXXXIII, Figs. 1-209.</p>

<p>Pottery of the Ancient Pueblos, by William H. Holmes; pp. 257-360,

FIELD WORK.</a></h5>

<p>The field work of the year is divided into (1)&nbsp;mound
explorations and (2)&nbsp;general field studies, embracing those
relating to social customs, institutions, linguistics, pictography, and
other divisions of anthropology.</p>

WORK OF PROF. CYRUS THOMAS.</a></h6>

<p>The work of exploring the mounds of the eastern United States was, as
in previous years, under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas.</p>

<p>Although Prof. Thomas and his assistants have devoted a large portion
of the year to the study of the collections made in the division of
mound exploration and to the preparation of a report of its operations
for the last five years, yet some field work of importance has been
done.</p>

<p>Prof. Thomas in person examined the more important ancient works of
New York and Ohio. He gave special attention to the latter, with a view
of determining where new and more accurate descriptions, surveys, and
illustrations were necessary. It was found requisite to undertake a
careful resurvey and description of a number of the well known works in
Ohio. This reexamination was the more necessary in view of the light
shed on the origin and use of these monuments by the explorations which
had been carried on in West Virginia, western North Carolina, and
eastern Tennessee.</p>

<p>Mr. J. P. Rogan continued his work as assistant until the close of
November, when he voluntarily resigned his position to enter upon other
engagements. A&nbsp;portion of his time during the first month was
occupied in arranging and preparing for shipment the collection
purchased of Mrs. McGlashan, in Savannah, Georgia. The rest of his time
was employed in exploring mounds along the upper Savannah River in
Georgia and South Carolina and along the lower Yazoo River in
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Mr. J. W. Emmert continued to act as field assistant until the end of

a short visit to central New York, were confined to eastern Tennessee,
chiefly Blount, Monroe, and Loudon counties, where numerous extensive
and very interesting groups are found in the section formerly occupied
by the Cherokees. Prof. Thomas thought it necessary to devote
considerable attention to the ancient works of that region, as it is

probable that there and in western North Carolina is to be found the key
that will materially assist in solving the problem of the peculiar works
of Ohio. The results of these explorations are of unusual interest,
independent of their supposed bearing on the Ohio mounds.</p>

<p>Mr. James D. Middleton, who has been a constant assistant in the
division since its organization, after completing some investigations
begun in southern Illinois, visited western Kentucky for the purpose of
investigating the works of that section, but was soon afterwards called
to Washington to take part in the office work. During the month of June
he visited and made a thorough survey of the extensive group of works
near Charleston, West Virginia, of which Colonel Norris had made a
partial exploration, the latter having been prevented from completing it
by the sickness which immediately preceded his death. During the same
month Mr. Middleton commenced the survey of the Ohio works before
alluded to, obtaining some valuable results in the short time before the
close of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Gerard Fowke was also engaged for a short time in field work in
western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, but was called early in autumn
to Washington to assist in office work.</p>

WORK OF MR. A. S. GATSCHET.</a></h6>

<p>During October and December Mr. Albert S. Gatschet was engaged in
gathering historic and linguistic data in Louisiana, Texas, and the
portion of Mexico adjoining the Rio Grande, which region contains the
remnants of a number of tribes whose language and linguistic affinity
are practically unknown. After a long search Mr. Gatschet found a small
settlement of Biloxi Indians at Indian Creek, five or six miles west of
Lecompte, Rapides Parish, Louisiana, where they gain a livelihood as day
laborers. Most of them speak English more than their native tongue; in
fact, about two-thirds of the thirty-two survivors speak English only.
The vocabulary obtained by him discloses the interesting fact that the
Biloxi belong to the Siouan linguistic family.</p>

<p>He heard of about twenty-five of the Tunika tribe still living in
their old homes on the Marksville Prairie, Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana.
An excellent vocabulary was obtained of their language at Lecompte,
Louisiana, and a careful comparison of this with other Indian languages
shows that the Tunika is related to none, but represents a distinct
linguistic family. He was unable to collect any information in regard to
the Karankawa tribe, concerning which little is known except that they
lived upon the Texan coast near Lavaca Bay.</p>

<p>Leaving Laredo County, Texas, he visited Camargo, in Tamaulipas,
Mexico, finding near San Miguel the remnants of the Comecrudo tribe, or,
as they are called by the whites, Carrizos. Only the older men and women
still remember their language. The full-blood Comecrudos seen were tall
and thin, some of them with fairer complexions than the Mexicans.
Subsequently the Cotoname language, formerly spoken in the same
district, was studied and found to be a distinctly related dialect of
Comecrudo. Both of them belong to the Coahuiltecan family. From the
Comecrudo Mr. Gatschet obtained the names of a number of extinct tribes
which formerly lived in their vicinity, but of which no representatives
are left. These are the Casas Chiquitas, Tejones (or&nbsp;“Raccoons”),
Pintos or Pakawas, Miakkan, and Cartujanos. He next visited the
Tlaskaltec Indians, who live in the city of Saltillo. Of these Indians
about two hundred still speak their own language, which is almost
identical with the Aztec, although largely mixed with Spanish.</p>

Owing to disintegration of the sandstone rocks, the painted outlines of
animals and other figures are becoming slowly obliterated, though
sufficient remained to show their similarity to others in various
portions of the region which it is believed was occupied by the Cherokee
Indians. Similar outlines were reported to have been formerly visible on
the same river, as well as on the Tennessee, near Knoxville, Tennessee,
though no traces of them were found.</p>

<p>The next place visited was a few miles distant from and northwest of
Liberty, Tazewell County, Virginia, where some painted characters still
remain in a good state of preservation. They are on the sandstone cliffs
near the summit of the mountains and consist of human figures, birds,
and other forms, appearing to resemble artistically those of North
Carolina. Five miles eastward, on the same range, is a single
diamond-shaped cluster of red and black marks, no other forms being
visible. This rock is known in the surrounding country as the
“Handkerchief Rock,” because of its resemblance to an outspread colored
handkerchief. He then proceeded to Charleston, West Virginia, obtaining
copies of petroglyphs on Big Horse Creek, 12 miles southwest of that
place, and at several points along the Kanawha River. It was learned
that 20 miles south of Charleston, on the reputed trail leading from the
Kanawha Valley into Kentucky, “painted trees” formerly marked the
direction of the trails leading into the Cherokee country, and into
Kentucky. These trees bore various marks in red, but no accurate
information pertaining to the precise form of the characters could be
ascertained. At the other points mentioned characters were noticed
resembling in general those found in other portions of the Eastern and
Middle States known to have been occupied by tribes of the Algonquian
linguistic family.</p>

<p>The “Indian God-Rock,” 115 miles north of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on
the Alleghany River, was next examined and sketches were made of the
figures. This rock is an immense bowlder, the sculptured face of which
is about 15 feet high and from 8 to 10 feet broad, and lies at the
water’s edge. The figures upon the lower surface are being gradually
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXIII</span>
<a name = "pageXXIII" id = "pageXXIII"> </a>
<!--png 025-->
obliterated by erosion from floating logs and driftwood during seasons
of high water, while those upon the upper portions are being ruined by
the visitors who cut names and dates over and upon the sculptured
surfaces. Another place visited was on the Susquehanna River,
3&nbsp;miles below Columbia, Pennsylvania. Here a small stream empties
into the river from the east, along whose course several rocks were
found bearing deeply cut and polished grooves, indicating a nearly east
and west direction. These rocks are believed to be on the line of one of
the Indian trails leading to the Delaware River, similar to that at
Conowingo, Maryland, which was the last locality inspected, and which is
known as “Bald Friar.” A large mass of rock projecting from the bed of
the river is almost covered with numerous circles, cup-shaped
depressions, human forms, and ellipses, strongly resembling characters
from other points in the regions formerly occupied by the Algonquian
family. Measurements and sketches of these petroglyphs were made, with a
view to future reproduction upon models.</p>

A STUDY OF PUEBLO ARCHITECTURE, TUSAYAN AND CIBOLA, BY&nbsp;VICTOR
MINDELEFF.</a></h6>

<p>This study relates to the ruins and inhabited towns found in that
immense southwestern region composed of the arid plateaus which is
approximately bounded on the east by the Rio Pecos and the west by the
Colorado River, on the north by Central Utah, and which extends
southward to yet undetermined limits in Mexico. The present paper is
more directly confined to the ancient provinces of Tusayan and Cibola
which are situated within the drainage of the Little Colorado River, and
the intention is to follow and supplement it by studies of other typical
groups in the region, but the necessary comparisons and generalizations
now presented apply to all the varied features which are observed in the
remains of Pueblo architecture now scattered over thousands of square
miles. The work of surveying and platting in this vast field, together
with the consequent coordination of studies and preparation of
illustrations, has occupied the author and Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff a large
amount of time since the year 1881, though it did not include all of
their duties performed during that period.</p>

<p>The title of the paper, which only indicates architecture, fails to
do justice to the broad and suggestive treatment of the subject. It
would be expected, indeed required, that the surveys should be accurate
in details and that the physical features of the region should be
exhaustively described, but while all this is well done, much more
matter of a different though related class, and of great value to
ethnology, is furnished. The history, prehistoric and recent, the
religion, the sociology and the arts of the people, with their home life
and folklore, are studied and discussed in a manner which would be
creditable in essays devoted to those special subjects, but are so
employed as to be thoroughly appropriate to the elucidation of the
general theme.</p>

<p>The chapter on the traditional history of Tusayan, which is the
individual compilation of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, is an important and
interesting contribution relative to the history, migrations, and
mythology of the people. The traditions are, however, used with proper
caution, the fact being recognized that they seldom contain distinct
information, but are often of
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXXI</span>
<a name = "pageXXXI" id = "pageXXXI"> </a>
<!--png 033-->
high value from their incidental allusions and in their preservation of
the conditions of the past which influenced the lines and limitations of
their growth.</p>

<p>The classification and account of the Pueblo phratries and gentes
form an important contribution to anthropology, and the discussion upon
the origin and use of the kivas is more explanatory and exhaustive than
any before made on that subject. This word of the Tusayan language is
adopted to take the place of the Spanish term “estufa,” which literally
means a stove, and is misleading, because it strictly applies only to
the sweat houses which lodge-building Indians use. The kiva is the
ceremonial chamber of the ancient and modern Pueblo peoples. They are
found wherever the remains of Pueblo architecture occur, and are
distinguished from the typical dwelling rooms by their size and position
and generally by their form. The author dwells instructively upon the
antiquity, excavation, access, exterior masonry, orientation, and
general construction, furniture, and ornaments of these remarkable
chambers, and upon the rites connected with them. He also gives an
original and acute suggestion to account for the persistence of the
structural plan of the kivas by its religious or mythologic
signification.</p>

<p>The designation of the curious orifice of the sipapuh as “the place
from which the people emerged,” in connection with the peculiar
arrangement of the kiva interior with its change of floor level,
suggested to Mr. Mindeleff that these features might be regarded as
typifying the four worlds of the genesis myth that has exercised such an
influence on Tusayan customs. He was also led to infer that it typifies
the “four houses” or stages described in their creation myths. The
sipapuh, with its cavity beneath the floor, is certainly regarded as
indicating the place of beginning, the lowest house under the earth, the
abode of Myuingwa, the Creator; the main or lower floor represents the
second stage; and the elevated section of the floor is made to denote
the third stage, where animals were created. At the New Year festivals
animal fetiches were set in groups upon this platform. It is also to be
noted that the ladder to the surface is invariably made of pine, and
always rests upon the platform, never upon the lower floor, and in
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXXII</span>

<!--png 034-->
their traditional genesis it is stated that the people climbed up from
the third house (stage) by a ladder of pine, and through such an opening
as the kiva hatchway. The outer air is the fourth world, or that now
occupied.</p>

<p>Another apt observation is connected with the evolution of ornament,
and was prompted to the author by the common use of small chinking
stones for bringing the masonry to an even face after the larger stones
forming the body of the wall had been laid in place. This method of
construction in the case of some of the best built ancient pueblos
resulted in the production of marvelously finished stone walls, in which
the mosaic-like bits are so closely laid as to show none but the finest
joints on the face of the wall, with but little trace of mortar. The
chinking wedges necessarily varied greatly in dimensions to suit the
sizes of the interstices between the larger stones of the wall. The use
of stone in this manner probably suggested the banded walls that form a
striking feature in some of the Chaco houses. In connection with these
walls the seams of stone of two degrees of thickness, which are
observable in the cliffs, naturally suggested to the builders their
imitation by the use of stones of similar thickness in continuous bands.
The ornamental effect of this device was originally an accidental result
of adopting the most convenient method of using the material at
hand.</p>

<p>The author exhibits the result of thoughtful study in his expressed
views upon the mooted questions of racial origins and diffusions. He
noted that some of the ruins connected traditionally and historically
with Tusayan and Cibola differ in no particular from those stone pueblos
widely scattered over the southwestern plateaus which from time to time
have been invested by travelers and writers with a halo of romance and
regarded as the wondrous achievements in civilization of a vanished but
once powerful race. These abandoned stone houses found in the midst of
desert solitudes excited the imaginations of early explorers to connect
the remains with “Aztecs” and other mysterious peoples. From this early
implanted bias arose many ingenious theories concerning the origin and
disappearance of the builders of the ancient pueblos.</p>

<p>In connection with the architectural examination of some of
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXXIII</span>
<a name = "pageXXXIII" id = "pageXXXIII"> </a>
<!--png 035-->
these remains many traditions were obtained from the living members of
the tribes, several of which are published in the present paper, and
which clearly indicate that some of the village ruins and cliff
dwellings have been built and occupied by ancestors of the present
Pueblo Indians at a date well within the historic period. Both
architectural and traditional evidence are in accord in establishing a
continuity of descent from the ancient Pueblos to those of the present
day. Many of the communities are now made up of the more or less
scattered but interrelated remnants of gentes which in former times
occupied villages on the present or neighboring sites.</p>

<p>Mr. Mindeleff’s conclusions may be condensed as follows:</p>

<p>The general outlines of the development of architecture, wherein the
ancient builders were stimulated to the best use of the exceptional
materials about them both by the difficult conditions of their
semidesert environment and by constant necessity for protection against
their neighbors, can be traced in its various stages of growth from the
primitive conical lodge to its culmination in the large communal village
of many-storied terraced buildings which were in use at the time of the
Spanish discovery, and which still survive in Zuñi. Yet the various
steps have resulted from a simple and direct use of the material
immediately at hand, while methods gradually improved as frequent
experiments taught the builders to utilize more fully the local
facilities. In all cases the material was derived from the nearest
available source, and often variations in the quality of the finished
work are due to variations in the quality of the stone near by. The
results accomplished attest the patient and persistent industry of the
ancient builders, but the work does not display great skill in the
construction or the preparation of material.</p>

<p>The same desert environment that furnished an abundance of material
for the ancient builders, from its inhospitable character and the
constant variations in the water supply, also compelled the frequent use
of this material in the change of house and village sites. This was an
important factor in bringing about the degree of advancement attained in
the art of building. The distinguishing characteristics of Pueblo
architecture may therefore be regarded as the product of a defensive
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXXIV</span>
<a name = "pageXXXIV" id = "pageXXXIV"> </a>
<!--png 036-->
motive and of an arid environment that furnished an abundance of
suitable building material, and at the same time the climatic conditions
that compelled its frequent employment.</p>

<p>The cultural distinctions once drawn by writers between the Pueblo
Indians and neighboring tribes gradually become less clearly defined as
they have been intelligently studied. An understanding of their social
and religious system establishes the essential identity in their grade
of culture with that of other tribes. In many of the arts, too, such as
weaving and ceramics, these people in no degree surpass many tribes who
build ruder dwellings. Though they have progressed far beyond their
neighbors in architecture, many of the devices employed attest the
essentially primitive character of their art, and demonstrate that the
apparent distinction in grade of culture is mainly due to the
exceptional condition of their environment.</p>

<p>This important and timely paper furnishes new evidence taken from one
of the strongholds of sentimental phantasy to show that there is no need
for the hypothesis of an extinct race with dense population and high
civilization to account for the conditions actually existing in North
America before the European discovery.</p>

CEREMONIAL OF HASJELTI DAILJIS AND MYTHICAL SAND PAINTING OF THE NAVAJO
INDIANS, BY JAMES STEVENSON.</a></h6>

<p>This paper, apart from its intrinsic merits, has a peculiar interest
to American anthropologists from its being the last official work of Mr.
Stevenson, whose untimely death on July 25, 1888, was noticed in a
former report. It shows his personal characteristics, being a clear and
accurate statement of the facts actually observed and of the information
acquired by him at first hand, without diffuseness or unnecessary
theorizing.</p>

<p>Hasjelti Dailjis, in the Navajo tongue, signifies the dance of
Hasjelti, who is the chief or rather the most important and conspicuous
of the gods. The word dance does not well designate the ceremonies, as
they are in general more histrionic than saltatory. The whole of the
ceremonial, which lasts for nine days, is familiarly called among the
tribe “Yebitchai,” which means “the giant’s uncle,” this term being used
to awe the youthful candidates for initiation.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum roman">XXXV</span>
<a name = "pageXXXV" id = "pageXXXV"> </a>
<!--png 037-->
The ceremony witnessed by Mr. Stevenson was performed to cure a wealthy
member of the tribe of an inflammation of the eyes. Twelve hundred
Navajo Indians were present, chiefly as spectators, but that exhibition
of their interest may partly be accounted for by the fact that they
lived while on their visit at the expense of the invalid and occupied
most of the time in gambling and horse racing. The very numerous active
participants in the ceremonies, who might be called the mystery company,
in reference to the early form of our drama, were not directly paid for
their services, but acted because they were the immediate relatives of
the invalid for whose benefit the performance was given. The tribesman
who combined the offices of manager, theurgist, song priest, or master
of ceremonies was paid exorbitantly for his professional services. The
personation of the various gods and their attendants and the acted drama
of their mythical adventures and displayed powers exhibit features of
peculiar interest, while the details of the action day after day show
all imaginable and generally incomprehensible changes and multiplication
of costume and motions and postures and manipulations of feathers and
meal and sticks and paint and water and sand and innumerable other stage
properties in astounding complexity and seeming confusion. Yet, from
what is known of isolated and fragmentary parts of the dramatized myths,
it is to be inferred that every one of the strictly regulated and
prescribed actions has or has had a special significance, and it is
obvious that they are all maintained with strict religious scrupulosity,
indeed with constant dread of fatal consequences which would result from
the slightest divergence. In connection with this ritualistic form of
punctilio, which is noticed in the religious practices of other peoples
and lands, the established formal invocation of and prayer to the
divinity may be mentioned. It clearly offers a bribe or proposes the
terms of a bargain to the divinities, and has its parallel in the
archaic prayers of many other languages. Translated from the Navajo, it
is given as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
People of the mountains and roots [i.e., the gods, as shown by the
context], I&nbsp;hear you wish to be paid. I&nbsp;give to you food of
corn pollen and humming-bird feathers, and I send to you precious
stones, and
<span class = "pagenum roman">XXXVI</span>
<a name = "pageXXXVI" id = "pageXXXVI"> </a>
<!--png 038-->
tobacco, which you must smoke; it has been lighted by the sun’s rays,
and for this I beg you to give me a good dance; be with me! Earth,
I&nbsp;beg you to give me a good dance, and I offer to you food of
humming-bird’s plumes and precious stones, and tobacco to smoke lighted
by the sun’s rays, to pay for using you for the dance; make a good solid
ground for me, that the gods who come to see the dance may be pleased at
the ground their people dance upon; make my people healthy and strong of
mind and body.
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to his exhaustive account of the Hasjelti Dailjis and of
the curious dry-sand painting which the Navajo in common with the Pueblo
tribes make a prominent feature of their mysteries, and of which
illustrations are furnished, Mr. Stevenson presents translations of six
of the Navajo myths, some of which elucidate parts of the ceremony
forming the main title of his paper. These myths are set forth in a
simple and straightforward style, which gives intrinsic evidence that
they retain the spirit of the original. They are certainly free from the
pretentious embellishment and literary conceit which have perverted
nearly all the published forms of Indian myths and tales hitherto
accessible to general readers, and have even misled the numerous special
students who had no facilities for verification.</p>
